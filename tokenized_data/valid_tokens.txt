german bond yields seen falling in near term west german bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates , as seen in last month ' s paris pact , extend to keeping down european interest rates , banking economists said . but in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate west germany ' s economy , they said . the paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention , economists said . economists speculated that g - 7 countries may try to bolster the pact by <UNK> u . s . and west german interest rates further when they meet for the imf interim committee in april . `` the recent round of monetary <UNK> by the bundesbank and the bank of japan and the firming of the federal funds rate are significant . they mark an <UNK> of movements in u . s . and foreign interest rates , '' salomon bros inc said in a recent study . it said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar ' s fall . these spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized . west german bundesbank president karl otto poehl encouraged the u . s . not to cut interest rates in january when the bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point , to avoid weakening the dollar . west german economists see room for further cuts in leading west german rates if the dollar <UNK> its decline . `` it ' s not a <UNK> , '' peter <UNK> , spokesman for commerzbank ag said . but most economists see room for a cut in west german rates only in the first half of the year , as re - emerging inflation will limit room for <UNK> later in the year . the bundesbank ' s average yield of public paper is already nearing last year ' s low . last week , yields fell to around 5 . 50 pct , not far from the 1986 low of 5 . 35 pct posted in mid - april . economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer - term paper . such a move would tend to <UNK> the yield <UNK> between short and long - term rates , which has become more pronounced since the bundesbank lowered its discount rate . it might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates , as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the bundesbank ' s central bank money stock aggregate . but conflicting with this trend are plans to increase west german tax cuts , part of the paris currency pact designed to meet u . s . demands for faster west german growth . this move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue <UNK> which must be <UNK> by higher government borrowing . this may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak , but demand could emerge if rates begin rising . economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to <UNK> revenue loss from other sources , including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth , and higher than expected spending . <UNK> <UNK> , chief economist of the west german <UNK> - <UNK> , said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the west german government in november . any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up . but coupled with other factors such as <UNK> foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar ' s decline , long term yields may to have to rise , economists said . public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise <UNK> to increases in the second phase of bonn ' s tax reform package . the west german government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5 . 2 billion marks to 14 . 4 billion . west german chancellor helmut kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable . finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said last thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform , such as raising indirect taxes . but few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing . the bundesbank said in its february report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits . the bundesbank said west german public authorities <UNK> a large 21 . 9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14 . 8 billion in fourth quarter 1985 . the federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures , and also drew on two billion marks of bundesbank advances at the end of the year , when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter .

'' before the imf meeting , when the louvre accord was reaffirmed , the bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 3 . 60 pct , keating noted . economists said the united states now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the louvre accord and support the dollar in return for the german action on interest rates . any further sharp decline of the dollar would <UNK> washington ' s efforts to reduce its trade deficit , stoltenberg told a news conference on tuesday . he added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar ' s value . deutsche <UNK> ' s <UNK> stressed west germany ' s heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability . in addition , both the u . s . and west german central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast <UNK> intervening to support the dollar .

'' a strong performance from the 2 . 9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits , james capel said . a general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to cathay ' s revenue increase , but the company ' s load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services . james capel estimated cathay ' s passenger - <UNK> <UNK> last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight - <UNK> <UNK> climbed 17 pct , though the airline ' s load factor probably fell to 68 . 8 pct from 70 pct . `` cathay added new planes , and was forced to <UNK> some routes last year because of the threat of competition from <UNK> air , '' said <UNK> . `` this affected its load factor .

'' the ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days . the chairman of one of spain ' s leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year .

ec commission defends oils and fats tax a spokesman for the european community commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats , saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax . <UNK> <UNK> , head of division of the commission ' s <UNK> general for agriculture , told the <UNK> antwerp oils and fats contact days `` the commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be <UNK> by community producers in the oils and fats sector ... would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to <UNK> the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy . '' the proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from <UNK> oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable , <UNK> said . recent estimates put these costs at 4 . 0 billion european currency units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2 . 0 billion ecus , he said . in 1990 the community ' s `` standstill `` agreements with spain and portugal end and the ec would then feel the full impact of its <UNK> . the commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system , he added . under the commission ' s system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector , a reference price of 700 ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced , <UNK> said . consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level . he said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the common agricultural policy ' s oils and fats regime . `` the commission believes that hostile <UNK> ( to the proposed tax ) have for the most part been based on <UNK> or an <UNK> <UNK> analysis of the proposal , '' he said . <UNK> said the proposed system <UNK> with general agreement on tariffs and trade , gatt , rules . it would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products , and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats . ec - produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements , he said . the competitiveness between different oils , whether ec produced or imported , would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax , <UNK> said . the proposed system would not alter the ec nations ' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise community production levels without affecting demand , he said . it is one of the proposal ' s objectives to maintain current import levels , he said . imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the ec ' s <UNK> and meals requirements , which are not covered by the stabilising system . furthermore , more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re - exported to third countries , <UNK> added .

energy / drilling industry the drastic cutbacks in u . s . drilling last year are rapidly <UNK> the united state ' s natural gas <UNK> , which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the <UNK> , industry analysts said . <UNK> <UNK> of natural gas , a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities , could more than double the current u . s . rig count to near 2 , 000 by 1990 , some analysts said . the need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the gulf of mexico ' s offshore waters where some of the nation ' s largest gas reserves are located . `` we think an upturn in u . s . drilling is imminent , '' said james <UNK> , an analyst with salomon brothers inc . `` many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they ' re <UNK> that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two . '' the prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely <UNK> last year ' s plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a barrel to less than half that . today ' s relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the <UNK> days of 1981 when the u . s . drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than 4 , 500 and oilfield <UNK> <UNK> premium wages . the latest weekly hughes tool co & lt ; ht > rig count , a <UNK> of the oil industry ' s health , showed 761 u . s . rigs active in what is traditionally the <UNK> time of the year . in 1986 , the hughes rig count began the year at 1 , 915 but <UNK> to a post - world war ii low of 663 in july as world oil prices experienced the <UNK> decline in recent times . <UNK> kerridge , a hughes economist , said `` in 1986 , the united states replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate won ' t be any better this year . '' he added , `` we don ' t have the options we do with oil . imports of gas from canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be <UNK> in the next 10 years because of the cost . '' only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while u . s . consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet , according to industry estimates . george <UNK> , an oil analyst with robert w . baird and co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in u . s . drilling . `` we anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to <UNK> to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies . that means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid - 1988 , '' <UNK> said . <UNK> said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 2 , 000 in december of 1989 . much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the gulf of mexico , where federal leases on <UNK> areas will <UNK> back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years . some of the industry ' s biggest companies , such as exxon corp & lt ; xon > , mobil corp mob , and union texas petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the gulf of mexico , <UNK> said . for example , conoco inc , a dupont & lt ; dd > subsidiary , will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the gulf of mexico ' s <UNK> production platform , which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day . but t . boone pickens , who has acquired huge texas and kansas gas reserves for his <UNK> limited partnership & lt ; <UNK> > in recent months , is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the <UNK> of a recovery . pickens predicts the u . s . rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do . `` the rigs won ' t go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs a barrel , '' said pickens , 58 , adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 2 , 000 again in his <UNK> . tenneco inc & lt ; tgt > , one of the largest u . s . gas producers , is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists . tenneco vice president joe foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the u . s . gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years ' supply . current spot market prices of about 1 . 50 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement , he said .

south korea to maintain trade surplus 3 - 5 years south korean trade minister rha woong bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt . he said in an interview with reuters that after a few years it was likely south korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position . he said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44 . 5 billion dlr foreign debt . rha said that 1986 was the first year south korea had a trade surplus - 4 . 5 billion dlrs , against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs . asked if south korea would drop its trade barriers once its foreign debt was substantially reduced , he said `` yes , i think so .

west german institutes call for early tax cuts the five leading west german economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990 . in their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts , with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth . gross national product grew 2 . 4 pct last year . but the report said all the institutes believed that `` more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created . '' the institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible . `` from this point of view , the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward . '' the government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform . the net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks . however , the institutes criticised the government , not only for the timing of the reform , but also because the question of its financing had been left open . the government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for , though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies . the institutes said this lack of <UNK> from bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government . they also said the government should reduce tax <UNK> , which would <UNK> the fiscal system , urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value - added tax . the institutes also criticised bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged . they referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies . the institutes said total subsidies , including tax <UNK> , had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then . given the scope of these subsidies , it should be possible `` despite ... major political difficulties `` to finance the tax reform by cutting state <UNK> . the institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost . the report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to <UNK> state companies and said more deregulation was needed . the government had to aim for more competition , it said .

glickman <UNK> hard for 0 / 92 farm plan implementation of a one - year 0 / 92 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions . `` we have a budget driven farm policy . it may be a <UNK> , but we are <UNK> into this , '' said dan glickman , ( d - <UNK> . ) , chairman of the subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feed grains . `` we need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer . a 0 / 92 plan , if properly done , could do both . '' glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0 / 92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains . an aide to glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week . glickman said a 0 / 92 program , which allows a farmer to <UNK> planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment , would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill -- only an extension of the 50 / 92 option already provided under the current bill . it is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill , he said , but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals , a voluntary 0 / 92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices , as usda has proposed . a 0 / 92 plan , however , would not be <UNK> , but simply a different type of acreage diversion program , glickman said . <UNK> -- <UNK> planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point , he said . `` i don ' t think there is any interest in pursuing a <UNK> bill this year . period . <UNK> , '' glickman said at the hearing . sen . <UNK> <UNK> ( r - minn . ) , <UNK> of the <UNK> / <UNK> <UNK> plan , said he supports a short term 0 / 92 program as a move to a more <UNK> <UNK> plan . <UNK> plans to introduce a 0 / 92 plan in the senate . his plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers , require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> on extra idled acreage , limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide <UNK> protection provisions . `` i know we can not obtain complete <UNK> in 1987 , but we can at least move in that direction , '' <UNK> said . <UNK> johnson , vice president of cargill , inc . , <UNK> in favor of <UNK> . <UNK> would end the current <UNK> in u . s . farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers ' <UNK> on the government , he said . a 0 / 92 plan does not go far enough in <UNK> , johnson said , and would still encourage farmers to plant . officials from the national corn growers association and the national <UNK> ' s association said their groups oppose any 0 / 92 or <UNK> plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers . but when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0 / 92 program , larry johnson of the corn growers said they would agree to 0 / 92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels .

norway extends 7 . 5 pct oil output cut - ministry norway will extend its 7 . 5 pct cutback in planned north sea oil output in support of opec from july 15 until the end of this year , oil ministry spokesman <UNK> <UNK> told reuters . `` we took a very positive view of the opec meeting in vienna , '' he said . `` the accord reached there means stability in the oil market and we shall continue making our contribution . '' the cuts , originally brought in from february 1 , would probably be officially approved on july 10 by parliament , <UNK> said . the ministry had written to norway ' s oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts . opec agreed this weekend in vienna on an output ceiling of 16 . 6 mln barrels per day ( bpd ) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its december accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point . opec ' s first half 1987 output ceiling was 15 . 8 mln bpd , and it ' s december pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16 . 6 mln bpd , rising to 18 . 3 mln in the fourth quarter . norway , which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields , previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if opec remained within its december accord on output and prices . norway ' s oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840 , 000 bpd in 1986 . since then it has risen to around one mln bpd , and is expected to reach about 1 . 5 mln bpd by 1995 . the 7 . 5 pct cut from planned production implemented since february reduced norway ' s oil output by about 80 , 000 bpd . norway ' s oil minister <UNK> <UNK> , currently in <UNK> for a meeting of <UNK> ministers , has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks . over the past year several other leading non - opec producers , including the soviet union , mexico , china , malaysia and egypt have also pledged support for opec ' s bid to keep prices stable . norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an opec agreement last december which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last december . norway <UNK> on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986 . but firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit . norway ' s north sea <UNK> britain has consistently refused to cooperate with opec output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production .

major differences resolved at rubber pact talks negotiators at a united nations conference on a new international natural rubber agreement ( inra ) have agreed on basic elements in a new pact , conference chairman manaspas xuto said . `` we have resolved major differences of opinion , '' he told reuters . xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord , to replace the current one which expires in october . xuto said : `` i welcome the friendly and cooperative atmosphere that has <UNK> without <UNK> `` since the talks began last monday . `` it is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to <UNK> the new agreement , '' he added . the renegotiation conference , under the auspices of the u . n . conference on trade and development ( <UNK> ) , is the fourth such meeting in two years . xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four points : 1 ) regular price reviews will be held every 15 months . previously consumers were proposing 12 - month <UNK> between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact . 2 ) if the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below ( or above ) the lower intervention price ( or the upper intervention price ) , the reference price will be automatically revised downwards ( or upwards ) by five pct unless the international natural rubber organisation council decides on a higher percentage . if buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300 , 000 tonnes , the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage . 3 ) if the buffer stock reaches 400 , 000 tonnes , the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150 , 000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two malaysian / singapore cents above the floor price -- or 152 cents . 4 ) the floor price will not be breached . throughout the talks producers had <UNK> resisted a consumer proposal to lower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock , currently 360 , 000 tonnes , rose to 450 , 000 tonnes . the proposal , initiated by the u . s . , was withdrawn last night , setting the stage for compromise . legal drafting of provisions will start next week and formal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking part in the conference is expected to take place on march 20 . the current conference was widely seen as the last chance to <UNK> a deal . three previous attempts to negotiate a new five - year pact had failed , the last round breaking down in october over consumer demands for tighter controls of the buffer stock . the united states , japan , west germany , france , italy and britain are the major consumers . <UNK> ' s latest estimates project an increase of 8 . 5 pct in rubber prices this year and 4 . 1 pct in 1988 .

reagan to announce decision on japan sanctions president reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls japan ' s failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade . the 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the u . s . trade representative ' s office . reagan announced last march 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from <UNK> and television sets to power tools and <UNK> film . the panel this week <UNK> through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to santa barbara , where reagan is <UNK> . in his march <UNK> , reagan said `` i am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide american industry with free and fair trade opportunities . '' he added the tariffs would be lifted once japan <UNK> the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to u . s . products . u . s . officials said japan had done nothing since the march announcement to alter reagan ' s plan to <UNK> the sanctions . white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said yesterday : `` we do not want a trade war , but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action . '' reagan ' s move follows steadily rising u . s . trade <UNK> , with last year ' s hitting a record <UNK> 169 . 8 billion . about one - third of the deficit is in trade with japan . congress is <UNK> a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices . he has opposed the legislation , saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and , in any case , that existing law was <UNK> to end unfair trade practices . trade experts say his tough action against the japanese was as much to <UNK> the japanese as to show congress he did not need any new trade legislation . the japanese have complained that they have been <UNK> the semiconductor pact , but that it would take time before the results showed up . u . s . officials , however , have said their monitoring of japanese semiconductor shipments to east asian countries and western europe showed no <UNK> in the dumping and that the japanese home markets remained shut to american exports . japan has said that if reagan imposed the tariffs , it would file a complaint with the general agreement on tariff and trade ( gatt ) . it said hoped gatt would find the u . s . retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or japanese retaliation . u . s . officials have said they did not think japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the united states .
currency intervention timing crucial - analysts the dollar ' s recent decline , despite massive central bank purchases , is a <UNK> <UNK> that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well - <UNK> to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment , dealers and analysts said . central banks may succeed in slowing a trend , but , without accompanying policy changes , they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever - growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day , the sources said . `` timing and <UNK> are the key to successful intervention , '' said jim o ' neill , a financial markets economist with marine midland banks inc . the importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was <UNK> yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar , <UNK> achieving what the central banks had tried in <UNK> to do for a week through open market intervention . after citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter - point to 7 - 3 / 4 pct , the first change in the rate since last august , the dollar started to advance and reached a high in tokyo of 147 . 50 yen , up two yen from tuesday ' s new york low . by contrast , monetary authorities <UNK> by the bank of japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of march but could not prevent the dollar from <UNK> through 150 yen and <UNK> a 40 - year low monday of 144 . 70 yen . some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar . the market is wary of being caught wrong - <UNK> by a central bank <UNK> , but is no longer <UNK> . `` they ' ve lost their credibility . the market feels it can take on the central banks and win , '' said michael snow , head of treasury operations at union bank of switzerland in new york . the relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks <UNK> when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the september 22 , 1985 , plaza accord . then , however , central banks had an easy time of it , because the markets and the <UNK> of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances . now , there is no such consensus . the market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the u . s . trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement , while japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries . for its part , the united states is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than <UNK> service to the february paris agreement of the group of five plus canada to foster stability , dealers say . specifically , they said the fed ' s dollar - buying intervention has been half - <UNK> , designed more as a political gesture to japan than to strike fear into the markets . `` it ' s been pro - forma intervention , '' said <UNK> <UNK> - <UNK> , chief corporate trader at credit <UNK> . because of this <UNK> and the market ' s momentum for a lower dollar , analysts said intervention looks <UNK> to fail . `` it ' s going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar ( at these levels ) , '' said snow , who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation . `` there have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars , '' added `` buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it . '' late last decade during the presidency of <UNK> carter , when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack , central banks sometimes intervened to the <UNK> of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 1 . 70 marks , analysts said . snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely . `` i don ' t think <UNK> has the <UNK> for it , because they saw the <UNK> of it in the <UNK> . '' indeed , because the market has grown in <UNK> and bound since then , intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to <UNK> the market . trading volume in london , new york and tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day , according to a joint central bank study , about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the group of thirty private research group . there are signs that central banks , too , realize the <UNK> of <UNK> against the tide . bank of japan sources told reuters in tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for <UNK> the dollar , such as <UNK> currency swap agreements with other central banks , are being considered . `` in this <UNK> of financial liberalization , it ' s almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of japan , '' one senior official in tokyo said .

oecd sees major adjustment for australia australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance , the organisation for economic cooperation and development said in its latest annual review of the australian economy . it said australia had a current external deficit of 5 - 3 / 4 pct of gross domestic product , high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of gdp , growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct , far higher than that of other oecd countries . a major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non - inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved , but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since june 1985 . a major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4 - 1 / 2 pct of gdp by 1990 - 91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential , for employment to grow , and for the debt / gdp ratio to stabilize , it said . success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy , a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector <UNK> . looking ahead over the next 18 months , the oecd expected economic performance to improve , partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy , and a substantial improvement in trade volumes . it said positive gdp growth of three pct might be restored , the current external deficit could fall to some 4 - 1 / 2 pct of gdp by the first half of next year , while inflation was projected to <UNK> to around five to 5 - 1 / 2 pct by mid - 1988 . continued real wage <UNK> was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the australian dollar ' s depreciation , and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment . the report urged australia to <UNK> its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries , and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances . it added australia should reduce protection levels in manufacturing , even though faster trade liberalisation would no doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry .

rubber stock manager says quality acceptable international rubber organisation ( <UNK> ) buffer stock manager <UNK> <UNK> said tests had shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable , but acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it . `` we have said all along that the rubber is holding up well from a condition and quality <UNK> ... rubber stored in proper conditions does not <UNK> , '' he told reuters in a telephone interview . the quality of buffer stock rubber sold since he entered the market in september would be discussed at an <UNK> council meeting which opened here today , he said . tokyo traders said on friday they had little interest in buying rubber from the <UNK> buffer stock because of possible poor quality . <UNK> began selling rubber when prices exceeded the `` may - sell ' level of 232 cents per kg early last month . <UNK> ' s five - day moving average was quoted at 237 . 3 cents on october 16 . he said the quality of five to six - year old rubber in stock was <UNK> in consumers ' minds . `` we have received good interest for the rubber . i understand the japanese concern . many consumers want to try the rubber before they carry on buying , '' he said . <UNK> said <UNK> rubber was stored in 28 different locations in producing and consuming nations , adding all warehouses used were suitable for long - term storage . selling of buffer stock rubber had <UNK> off during the past week to 10 days and this could reflect a `` wait and see attitude `` by buyers , he said . `` consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts until they test out the rubber . if their tests are <UNK> , they are likely to buy more .

mixed asian reaction to new rubber pact governments of major asian producing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a new international natural rubber agreement ( inra ) , but growers and traders are unhappy with the development , according to views polled by reuter correspondents . officials in malaysia , indonesia and thailand , which produce the bulk of the world ' s rubber , said they expected the new pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubber industries remain viable in the long - term . but traders and growers said they were against the new pact because its buffer stock mechanism was likely to <UNK> with free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises . the new inra , to replace the current one which expires on october 22 , was formally adopted by most of the world ' s producers and consumers in geneva last friday . it will be open for <UNK> at the u . n . headquarters in new york from may 1 to december 31 this year and will enter into force provisionally when <UNK> by countries accounting for 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports . malaysian primary industries minister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> said the formal adoption of a new pact had <UNK> fears of liquidation of some 360 , 000 tonnes of inra buffer stock rubber and a possible depression of prices . he expressed confidence that the new inra would continue to keep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose or fell through its buffer stock system . malaysia was also happy that in the new inra financing of purchases for the normal buffer stock of 400 , 000 tonnes and a contingency buffer stock of 150 , 000 tonnes would be done through direct cash contributions from members , he said . under the existing pact , members can borrow from banks to finance inra ' s buffer stock purchases . this has been viewed with concern by some members who fear the inra may become indebted and ultimately face collapse , like the international tin agreement . `` this will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out without any financial <UNK> , '' <UNK> said . malaysia , the world ' s largest producer , was seeking cabinet approval to join the new inra and hoped other producers and consumers would also become members , he said . officials in jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit to indonesia ' s rubber industry ' s by stabilising prices . it was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because its new financial provisions had been tightened , they said . thai officials told reuters they were optimistic the new pact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt the inra buffer stock manager might <UNK> to his market operations . malaysian growers , however , said they preferred a free rubber market because an inra had a tendency to keep prices at levels that were only acceptable to consumers . `` with the inra ' s ability to keep prices at a certain stable level , consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price , while producers may never see sharp price rises , '' a malaysian rubber producers council source told reuters . producers also wanted a free rubber market without the overhang of a 360 , 000 tonne inra buffer stock which had <UNK> prevented price rises , he said . state <UNK> officials in sri lanka said prices had been depressed since inra ' s <UNK> and the creation of a buffer stock , and they seemed unlikely to rise . sri lanka should not be a member of the inra because it was expensive to maintain a buffer stock , they added . traders in the region , meanwhile , said prices might be pressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to stabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers to produce more . most malaysian and singapore traders said the new pact ' s conclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to allow sharp price fluctuations in future . `` the 360 , 000 tonnes in the inra buffer stock must be <UNK> and a free market returned , '' a malaysian trader said . japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success as most world producers and consumers had adopted it , but they questioned the ability of some financially - <UNK> producers to finance buffer stock operations .

dollar seen falling unless japan <UNK> economy underlying dollar sentiment is bearish , and operators may push the currency to a new low unless japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the paris accord , foreign exchange analysts polled by reuters said here . `` the dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150 . 00 yen and to fall even below that level , '' a senior dealer at one leading bank said . the dollar has eased this week , but remains stable at around 151 . 50 yen . six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in paris in february to foster currency stability . some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term , but a drastic fall is unlikely because of u . s . fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced japanese purchases of u . s . treasury securities , needed to finance the u . s . deficit . dealers generally doubted whether any economic package japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly , and said such measures would probably <UNK> further u . s . steps to weaken the dollar . under the paris accord , tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand , increase imports and cut its trade surplus . but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax , and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future , the dealers said . if no such steps are taken , protectionist sentiment in the u . s . congress will grow , putting greater downward pressure on the dollar , they said . the factors affecting the u . s . currency have not changed since before the paris accord , they added . `` underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still - sluggish u . s . economic outlook , the international debt crisis triggered by brazil ' s unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced <UNK> of the reagan administration as a result of the iran / <UNK> arms scandal , '' said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank . `` there is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140 . 00 yen by the end of this year , '' said chemical bank tokyo branch vice president <UNK> <UNK> . but operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention . dealers said there were widespread rumours that the u . s . federal reserve <UNK> some banks in new york to ask for quotes last wednesday , and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1 . 87 marks . the bank of england also apparently sold sterling in london when it <UNK> 1 . 60 dlrs on wednesday , they said . but other dealers said they doubted the <UNK> of central bank intervention , saying it may stimulate the dollar ' s decline because many dealers are likely to <UNK> such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars . however , first national bank of chicago tokyo branch assistant manager <UNK> <UNK> said `` the dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of march .

brazil has no set coffee export targets - ibc brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week ' s breakdown of international coffee organization talks on export quotas , president of the brazilian coffee institute , ibc , jorio dauster said . he told a press conference brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15 . 5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country ' s export target to ico - member countries . the 15 . 5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets , he added . it had been a gesture to ease negotiations , but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15 . 5 mln bags , he said . dauster said he would talk to producers , exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy , but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions . `` we will not take any short - term decisions which might cause markets to panic , '' dauster added . he said it would be a policy which shows brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ico agreement . `` brazil has coffee ( to sell ) and wants to show that it does not need an ico agreement as a <UNK> , '' dauster said . commenting on the breakdown of the talks , dauster said consumer proposals would have <UNK> a reduction of one to two mln bags in brazil ' s export quotas . `` it was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover , '' he said . the consumer proposal to base quotas on a six - year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas , he said . dauster rejected reports which said brazil ' s <UNK> had been the cause for the breakdown of talks , noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries . close links would continue with these producers , particularly colombia , mexico and <UNK> african countries , but dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present . he also said brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of <UNK> buying contracts , although `` no <UNK> has been abandoned . '' dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for may shipment coffee will be opened . he declined comment on whether the ibc will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance , as some exporters had suggested . he noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5 . 5 mln bags , more than half the 9 . 9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11 . 2 mln and 12 mln bags . he said that , although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop , the ibc would not make any estimate until late april .

house 0 / 92 plan seen <UNK> - back to 1987 wheat key members of the house agriculture committee have agreed to scale - back the 0 / 92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat , but a broader 0 / 92 proposal is likely to be <UNK> later , congressional sources said . the sources said key lawmakers including <UNK> . <UNK> english ( d - okla . ) , and dan glickman ( d - kan . ) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by rep . charles <UNK> ( d - tex . ) which would limit 0 / 92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat . this would scale - back the 0 / 92 provision to the original proposal by english allowing a pilot 0 / 92 program for 1987 wheat only . that provision was later <UNK> by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat . under 0 / 92 , a farmer can <UNK> planting a crop but still <UNK> 92 pct of deficiency payments . earlier today , the house agriculture committee postponed until next tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0 / 92 . the agreement to limit 0 / 92 to a wheat pilot program follows <UNK> criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0 / 92 , and by members of congress wary of reopening the farm bill . congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 0 / 92 . `` the timing ( of the proposal ) is off , '' said one aide to a house agriculture committee member . however , several congressional sources said they expect a broader 0 / 92 provision to emerge again when the house agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package . <UNK> <UNK> , aide to house majority leader tom <UNK> ( d - wash . ) , predicted agriculture ' s share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs . a broader 0 / 92 might be <UNK> later because both the congressional budget office and the reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings . a u . s . agriculture department official said 0 / 92 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1 . 5 billion dlrs over five years . another factor which could affect the 0 / 92 debate is the approach of planting season , congressional sources said . some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0 / 92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends march 31 for wheat and feedgrains . if congress approved 0 / 92 later in the year sign - up either would have to be extended or reopened , sources said .

ecuador to export no oil for 4 months , official the suspension of ecuador ' s crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months , a senior energy ministry official said . the official said ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline , which links jungle oil fields at lago agrio to balao on the pacific coast . it would take about 100 mln u . s . dlrs to repair the pipeline , the official , who did not want to be named , told reuters . ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks . the earthquake last thursday night registered six on the 12 - point international <UNK> scale . the damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to ecuador , where oil accounts for up to two - thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues . financially pressed ecuador , a member of the organisation of petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) , was recently pumping about 260 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude , about 50 , 000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel , another energy ministry spokesman said . last year , it exported an average of 173 , 500 bpd , according to the central bank . however , ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline , costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs , to <UNK> up with a colombian pipeline , the first official said . he estimated it could take about 60 days to build . ecuador , <UNK> by the slide in world oil prices in 1986 , had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of january , about equal to one month ' s imports . it suspended interest payments in january on 5 . 4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks . the country ' s total foreign debt is 8 . 16 billion dlrs , the eighth largest in latin america . in caracas , president jaime lusinchi said venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline . ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to venezuela in repayment in may , lusinchi said . a commission headed by venezuelan investment fund minister <UNK> <UNK> and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company petroleos de venezuela will travel to ecuador tuesday to evaluate and co - <UNK> an emergency relief program , he said .
<UNK> says effect of lower support prices limited efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success , the international wheat council ( <UNK> ) says in its latest monthly report . faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas , as employed in the united states , the <UNK> says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - argentina , australia , canada , the ec and the u . s . in some countries , for example australia and argentina , which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income , there may be problems in reducing production . a policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment , with job prospects outside agriculture limited . alternative crops may offer <UNK> returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems . the <UNK> outlines three <UNK> of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries . they could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy <UNK> demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated . <UNK> , support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold , without <UNK> to be stored for a long period . this option may prove to be the most politically <UNK> and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production , the report said . the third option would be for governments to <UNK> between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture , possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production . the <UNK> review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 . at some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses . these changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several <UNK> currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency . for example between 1985 / 86 and 1986 / 87 the ec intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209 . 30 to 179 . 44 european currency units ( ecus ) . it dollar terms , the currency in which most export transactions are denominated , the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 . the high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national <UNK> and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure , the report says . the proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 . this was partly due to increased production in china and india . the period saw an upward trend in yields , although this was <UNK> in the argentina , the u . s . and australia by lower <UNK> . in argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises , particularly livestock while lower u . s . <UNK> are attributed to official incentives .

'' heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted to own a financial services holding company , again with the provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise if necessary . heller said the effects of these actions `` would be banks that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them `` in which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to `` <UNK> the bank `` was removed . such diversification would give access to national and international financial services to corporations across the united states . heller said that would mean `` the steady decline of america ' s banks in the world financial <UNK> <UNK> would be arrested `` by <UNK> them to become more competitive .

institutes divided on outlook for german economy the five leading west german economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago . the three research groups of <UNK> , hamburg and <UNK> predicted in the institutes ' joint spring report that gross national product ( gnp ) would rise by two pct in 1987 , compared with 2 . 4 pct in 1986 . the five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in october last year . taking a <UNK> view , the diw institute of west berlin and <UNK> ' s <UNK> institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth . the joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the diw and <UNK> were `` markedly less favourable `` than those of the other three . the diw and <UNK> forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year . `` in the second half of 1987 there will , however , only be a weak upward movement , '' they said . the two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year . they saw exports falling by a real 2 - 1 / 2 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year . the other three institutes , however , wrote : `` the decline in demand and production ( seen ) in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical <UNK> . '' they said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans . but they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off . `` it can be <UNK> that the <UNK> actions ( on the economy ) will diminish markedly this year . '' they added : `` the domestic <UNK> for a continuation of the economic <UNK> are still favourable . '' these three institutes said diminishing external <UNK> combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring . however , this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar . contrary to the diw and <UNK> , the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987 , `` there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year . '' they predicted an overall 0 . 5 pct fall in exports in 1987 , the same as in 1986 . the three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987 , compared with 4 . 2 pct in 1986 , while diw and <UNK> predicted a three pct increase . they saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4 . 6 pct in 1986 . <UNK> and diw saw these investments rising by only two pct . all the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment . the <UNK> , hamburg and <UNK> institutes said the jobless total would average 2 . 17 mln in 1987 compared with 2 . 23 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200 , 000 . these three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures . the construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion . the diw and <UNK> said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector , while `` the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline . '' the diw and <UNK> said unemployment would only decline to 2 . 20 mln in 1987 from 2 . 23 mln in 1986 . they saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986 . the other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986 . the institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987 , after they declined in 1986 , and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 0 . 5 pct .

china seen unlikely to raise sugar imports china will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks , despite falling production and rising domestic demand , traders and the official press said . `` despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last 30 years , imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious , '' the farmers daily said . it said 1986 plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives , because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely <UNK> . the official press had estimated the 1986 / 87 sugar crop ( november / march ) at 4 . 82 mln tonnes , down from 5 . 2 mln a year earlier , and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year . the <UNK> 1986 / 87 sugar harvest was a record 521 , 500 tonnes , the provincial daily said . it gave no year - earlier figure . output in <UNK> was 1 . 04 mln tonnes , the new china news agency said without giving a year - earlier figure . the <UNK> daily said production in guangdong province fell to estimated 1 . 92 mln tonnes from 1 . 96 mln and that the area under sugar was dropping . `` supply of cane ( in guangdong ) is inadequate , '' the newspaper said . processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good . to guarantee supply of cane is a major problem . '' a western diplomat said sugar output also fell n fujian , south china ' s fourth major producer , where there was a drop in area planted . he said the rural sectors in guangdong and fujian were <UNK> developed , enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return , meaning that many had avoided sugar . the farmers daily said a <UNK> in the <UNK> province of <UNK> could gross 108 yuan from one <UNK> ( 0 . <UNK> hectares ) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one <UNK> of corn but only 70 from one <UNK> of sugarbeet . the paper said the profit margin of mills in china fell to 4 . 7 pct last year from 11 . 87 pct in 1980 . mills lacked the capital to modernise and they <UNK> with each other for raw <UNK> , it added . this resulted in falling <UNK> rates at big , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mills . the price of sugar had not changed in 20 years , the official press has said . customs figures showed china imported 1 . 18 mln tonnes of sugar in calendar 1986 , down from 1 . 9 mln in 1985 . the diplomat said stocks at end - august 1986 were 2 . 37 mln tonnes , up from 1 . 92 a year earlier . a foreign trader here said china accumulated large stocks in 1982 - 85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority . this practice was stopped in 1986 when the central government resumed control of imports . `` as china lacked storage , much of these imports was stored in <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> and other inland areas , '' the diplomat said . the trader said <UNK> stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south china was a problem , particularly as coal had priority . `` how quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels , '' he said . another factor was the quality of the harvest in cuba , china ' s major supplier through barter trade , he said . `` china bought two <UNK> cargoes last week , for about 152 / 153 dlrs a tonne , '' he added . `` china is not a desperate buyer now . but if the cuban harvest is bad , it will have to go into the open market . '' a japanese trader said peking ' s major concern regarding imports was price . `` while the foreign trade situation has improved this year , foreign exchange restraints persist , '' he said . the diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five pct a year but `` a communist government is in a much better position to regulate demand than a <UNK> one , if the foreign exchange situation demands it .

further declines in u . s . debt futures possible after an already steep fall in the past week , u . s . interest rate futures may be in for further declines in the near term , financial analysts said . however , some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond futures have left the bond market somewhat <UNK> , and the contracts on long - term debt could stage a recovery before <UNK> their decline . key to the near - term direction of futures will be the course of the dollar , they said . `` as the dollar goes , so goes the bond market , '' said dean witter analyst <UNK> gibbs . the recent decline in the dollar , which hit a 40 - year low against the japanese yen monday , was reversed wednesday when several large u . s . money center banks <UNK> raised their prime lending rates by a quarter point , to 7 - 3 / 4 pct . `` even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar , foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline is over , '' gibbs said . the dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt futures as it <UNK> concern about a pickup in inflation . indeed , the falling dollar may have been a key <UNK> at the meeting of the federal reserve ' s policy making arm , the federal open market committee , this week , analysts said . `` to the fed , the combination of a falling dollar , a <UNK> yield <UNK> , and rising commodity prices look <UNK> like the <UNK> of expectations of accelerating inflation , '' said denis <UNK> , analyst at carroll , mcentee and mcginley inc . such expectations could mean that `` a shift in policy toward restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious consideration , '' at the fomc meeting , he said . any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly visible form of monetary tightening , <UNK> said . rather , the key to <UNK> a change will be found in seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window , he said . borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln dlrs over the past several months , he said . in the meantime , however , `` the market looks a bit <UNK> , '' said jim <UNK> , analyst at golden <UNK> futures . <UNK> said a recovery from the <UNK> condition could drive june bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test chart support near the recent low of 97 - 13 / 32 . <UNK> leslie <UNK> of technical data corp of boston said that the key test for june bonds will be whether the nearby contract holds above chart support at 96 - 24 / 32 . `` all previous <UNK> since mid - november have stopped and buyers have <UNK> at that level , '' <UNK> said . if that level is broken , and the dollar continues to decline , <UNK> said she expects the june bond contract to decline to test support between 92 and 93 , the primary <UNK> line <UNK> back to 1984 .
