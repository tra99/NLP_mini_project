u . s . house approves pilot 0 / 92 disaster program the house of representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by <UNK> flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant . the one - time pilot 0 / 92 program , designed to assist farmers in kansas , oklahoma , michigan and parts of missouri , was passed by a 304 - 100 vote and sent to the senate . although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0 / 92 provision endorsed by the reagan administration , the u . s . agriculture department withheld its support from the measure . usda said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration ' s proposed broad - scale revision of farm programs . the bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received . to be eligible , winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring , although they could use the land for <UNK> or to plant <UNK> . usda estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs , largely because of reduced crop <UNK> . the bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the missouri and mississippi rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall ' s flooding . in addition , the measure would require usda to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by congress last fall . currently , because claims have <UNK> the 400 mln dlrs in <UNK> funds , usda plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses . the administration said it opposed the bill because , by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief , it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance . usda also said the 0 / 92 provisions in the bill were <UNK> than the administration ' s proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings . usda said the 0 / 92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs , while the requirement to compensate fully disaster - struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs , which must be <UNK> by congress . the feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs . usda estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs . in january the senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments . but the senate bill would not offer the 0 / 92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400 - mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program .

treasury ' s baker under fire for wall street drop as official washington sought to restore investor confidence after monday ' s wall street collapse , treasury secretary james baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to <UNK> the crisis . baker ' s weekend <UNK> at the west german bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an <UNK> of an international accord to stabilize currency values . nigel lawson , british chancellor of the exchequer , was among those who said the treasury secretary ' s statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already <UNK> investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy . lawson told a london television <UNK> tuesday , `` i think the scale of the ( stock ) fall was very great . that , i think , was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the atlantic . '' it was a dispute that should never have happened , he added . although baker appeared to <UNK> over the <UNK> at a <UNK> - called meeting with west german officials monday , he still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the united states on tuesday . baker cut short a long - planned trip to scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis . said one u . s . analyst of baker ' s weekend remarks , `` his timing could not have been worse . '' one government bond <UNK> in new york said , `` he actually thought that <UNK> at the germans , and threatening to <UNK> the dollar down would work . that doesn ' t show much understanding of international monetary <UNK> . '' however , some analysts said west germany ' s <UNK> march toward higher interest rates may have forced baker ' s hand . `` on the surface baker may look responsible for this , but if you go back to see what caused it ( <UNK> of financial markets ) , it was west german policy , '' said robert brusca of nikko securities international in new york . `` all mr . baker did was to mention the obvious in public , so making him responsible for it was a little like <UNK> the <UNK> , '' he said . after monday ' s talks , the u . s . and west german governments made it clear that the louvre currency accord , <UNK> together in paris in february , was still in effect . wall street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a <UNK> to <UNK> - inflation and economic <UNK> similar to the late 1970s . analysts believe monday ' s wall street crash <UNK> out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values . treasury sources said that baker , already unhappy about bonn ' s refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving , was angered by a bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the <UNK> . he felt that the u . s . recovery , <UNK> along in its <UNK> month , could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion . a growing u . s . economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports . moreover , baker , the <UNK> <UNK> , was worried that the republican party might face next year ' s presidential election with its main <UNK> -- a <UNK> economy -- badly <UNK> . a rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off u . s . economic growth that has already slowed to a <UNK> 3 . 2 pct annual rate . `` there ' s no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy , and it ' s important that the <UNK> turn around quickly , or else obviously the panic will feed on itself , and eventually there ' ll be a serious price to pay economically , '' former deputy treasury secretary richard darman said in a television interview . in many ways , the official response was mild . washington was <UNK> by the sudden wall street <UNK> , with president reagan speaking for most people by <UNK> that he was `` <UNK> .

gulf bond , stock markets lag behind , <UNK> says gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade , but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent <UNK> and lag behind , & lt ; gulf international bank <UNK> > ( <UNK> ) said . the bank ' s economist henry <UNK> said in a review of gulf capital markets that investors have to <UNK> traditional investment vehicles such as real estate , foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals . `` greater financial <UNK> is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts , '' he said . the <UNK> study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets , stock and bond markets . <UNK> said gulf states had been making greater use of short - term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various <UNK> and underwriting facilities . `` nevertheless , bond and stock markets remain , to a large extent , <UNK> and lagging behind , '' he said . most debt in the region is still raised by <UNK> loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues . only kuwait has an official stock exchange , while other gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges . but with <UNK> financial surpluses in the gulf , governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges , <UNK> said . he said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had `` clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region . '' in addition , family firms are reluctant to go public , financial <UNK> among investors is still <UNK> and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth . a sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery . <UNK> said the absence of proper commercial law in some gulf countries and authorities ' apparent reluctance to adopt financial <UNK> had also hampered capital markets . he called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments . <UNK> said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of gulf cooperation council ( gcc ) states -- bahrain , kuwait , qatar , oman , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates ( uae ) . some moves had been taken in this direction , with bahrain allowing gcc <UNK> to own up to 25 pct of locally <UNK> companies . <UNK> said gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in saudi arabia . but he added there is `` no bond market to speak of `` in saudi arabia , qatar , oman or the uae , with the last saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978 . while bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in saudi arabia has picked up , establishment of formal exchanges in qatar , oman and the uae does not appear imminent , <UNK> said .

joint action said vital to boost world growth prospects for world economic growth remain very sluggish , and coordinated action by western governments is <UNK> needed to restore business confidence , stabilize currencies and encourage investment , the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) said here . `` the economic situation has deteriorated in recent months , and ... slow growth , high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist , '' it said in one of its <UNK> reviews of the world economy in recent years . the gross national product ( gnp ) of the 24 - nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 2 . 25 pct both this year and next , even slower than last year ' s 2 . 5 pct growth rate . `` we would like to see the aggregate for the oecd area comfortably exceeding three pct , '' david henderson , head of the oecd ' s economics and statistics department , said . the oecd said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the u . s . , combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn . `` at the same time , many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable , '' it said , citing low inflation in most major countries , healthy corporate finances , generally lower interest rates , improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets . but private sector confidence had been <UNK> by uncertainties over exchange rates , it said , and warned that `` for confidence to be restored , it is important for governments <UNK> to implement internationally - agreed commitments . '' this was a clear reference to last february ' s louvre accord of the group of five nations plus canada , analysts said . the oecd said that apparent <UNK> among major countries on implementation of the louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence , and called on more active fiscal policies from the u . s . , west germany and japan to slow demand in the u . s . and raise it in the other two countries . henderson said the 6 , 000 billion yen package announced recently by the japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process , though it was too early to estimate its precise impact . he said the measures will help strengthen japan ' s domestic demand significantly , quite possibly exceeding one pct of gnp . the inflation outlook , while broadly satisfactory , has worsened in recent months , with oecd consumer prices forecast to rise 3 . 5 pct this year and 3 . 75 pct in 1988 after a 2 . 8 pct increase in 1986 . there is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months , with the average rate expected to stabilize at 8 . 25 pct , similar to last year . the oecd called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers .

'' but the adjustments may prove significant enough to <UNK> some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them , delegates said . the compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby , intermediate or forward positions , delegates said . if the compromise is accepted by the council , most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week , or as soon as <UNK> possible . the full council is scheduled to meet around <UNK> gmt to discuss the compromise , and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied , they said . consumers are due to meet before the council .

nakasone hard - pressed to <UNK> u . s anger on trade prime minister yasuhiro nakasone will visit washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting u . s . anger over japanese trade policies , but western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim . <UNK> in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans , nakasone will be hard - pressed to come up with anything new to tell u . s . president ronald reagan and key u . s . congressmen , they said . news of the week - long visit starting april 29 <UNK> with news that japan recorded a 8 . 14 billion dlr trade surplus last month , more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier . it also came one day after the reagan administration ' s economic policy council decided to take retaliatory action against japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips . nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up japan ' s <UNK> economy and imports in the short - term , the other to <UNK> the country in the medium term away from its over - dependence on exports for growth . but government officials said political <UNK> could <UNK> both packages of much of their <UNK> and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day . nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short - term economic measures until after its 1987 / 88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a <UNK> <UNK> that the budget was inadequate . but his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been <UNK> by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan . faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the u . s . virtually empty - handed , nakasone today ordered his ruling liberal democratic party ( ldp ) to come up with its own measures . he can then tell reagan the ldp package will form the basis of the government ' s plans , without losing face in parliament over the budget , political analysts said . officials working on the government ' s short - term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations , deregulation , measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices , and accelerated public investment . they said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987 / 88 fiscal year will take place in the first half , probably over 80 pct . diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy reagan , who is under pressure from the democrat - controlled u . s . congress to take greater action to cut the huge american trade deficit . to complement the short - term measures , nakasone is also likely to present reagan with details of japan ' s longer - term economic plans . a high - ranking advisory body headed by former bank of japan governor <UNK> maekawa is expected to come up with a final report <UNK> concrete steps to <UNK> the economy days before nakasone is scheduled to leave for washington . its recommendations are designed as a follow - up to maekawa ' s report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically <UNK> areas as agricultural reform and land policy , officials said . while <UNK> to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible , they said the political <UNK> might force them to water down some of the committee ' s recommendations . a subcommittee is considering what the japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it <UNK> massive restructuring , officials said . the subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of japan ' s total output , or gross national product , around 1993 or 1995 . last year the surplus , which measures trade in goods and services , amounted to over four pct of gnp . the subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen , to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993 , from 150 now .

lawson says some countries could cut rates nigel lawson , britain ' s chancellor of the exchequer , said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability . speaking to journalists one day after the group of seven countries reaffirmed goals set in paris six weeks ago , he said central banks would continue to intervene `` as and when necessary .

'' lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday ' s meetings at the slow progress the united states had made in reducing its budget deficit . `` we believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year . the important thing is that it continue year after year , '' lawson said . the february 22 louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then - current exchange rates . in the six weeks that followed the japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention . asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the louvre accord , he said , `` i don ' t think so . if there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness .

economic spotlight - bolivia bolivia , once latin america ' s most <UNK> debtor , is preparing for a second international monetary fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending . a fund spokesman said an imf team would visit la <UNK> shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement . he said the imf had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month . the accord provided for a stand - by loan , a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility . the spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed , bolivia can expect a further 60 - mln - dlr stand - by loan over the next 12 months . bolivia ' s agreement with the imf , its first since 1980 , opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the paris club and argentina and brazil , which hold 2 . 5 billion dlrs of bolivia ' s 4 . 0 - billion - dlr foreign debt . central bank president javier nogales told reuters the negotiations with the paris club , which have yet to be finalised , had been extremely successful . nogales said the paris club had agreed to reschedule bolivia ' s debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988 . bilateral discussions on interest rates continue , he said . nogales said bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in <UNK> this year from lender countries and international agencies , including the world bank and the inter - american development bank , although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs . nogales said bolivia ' s net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs , up from one mln dlrs when president <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> took office in august 1985 . nogales said the capital flow on bolivia ' s debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986 . bolivia ' s return from the financial <UNK> follows <UNK> <UNK> ' s economic stabilisation program . he <UNK> inflation of 23 , 000 pct a year , state enterprises that were losing hundreds of <UNK> of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate . <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> public sector wages , set a market - related rate for the peso , introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations . inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months , according to the central bank , and the government expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years . the government is also proposing a <UNK> solution to its debt to commercial banks , some 900 mln dlrs , on which interest has not been paid since march , 1984 . nogales said that over the next few months bolivia would make a one - time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 10 - 15 cents on the dlr . he said bolivia ' s commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in new york to consider the proposal , but it is still unclear what proportion of the country ' s creditor banks will take up the offer . one foreign banker speculated that bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal , mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country . but he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt - equity swaps , similar to that which has operated in chile for the past two years . the <UNK> government has yet to draw up proposals for debt - equity swaps , but the banker said it was planning to <UNK> more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme . foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to bolivia in the long run , especially as the government <UNK> that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow . planning minister <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> told reuters that bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years . the government <UNK> that in order to remain viable , bolivia will need to develop new exports . the price of tin , which accounted for some 45 pct of bolivia ' s exports in 1984 , has collapsed on the world markets , and gas , the country ' s major revenue <UNK> , is in <UNK> supply in the region .

hungary raises prices in effort to curb deficit hungary has announced sharp price increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit . the official mti news agency said the government decided consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state spending . from today the price of meat will rise by an average 18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct , mti said . the measures are also aimed at <UNK> an <UNK> economy , and could help dampen <UNK> ' <UNK> for imported western goods which <UNK> increasingly expensive hard currency , the diplomats said . the diplomats also said , however , that they did not expect the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in other east bloc states , notably poland . mti said consumer goods will also become more expensive , with the price of <UNK> rising some five pct . it also announced a number of measures to ease hardship , including higher pensions and family allowances .
u . s . jobs data said to rule out fed tightening a steep drop in goods - producing jobs <UNK> from u . s . march non - farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the federal reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar , economists said . u . s . march non - farm payroll employment rose 164 , 000 , less than the gain of 220 , 000 to 290 , 000 the financial markets expected . manufacturing employment fell 25 , 000 , compared with february ' s 50 , 000 gain , while march construction employment dropped 45 , 000 after being unchanged in february . `` the momentum of industrial activity is <UNK> off as we end the first quarter , '' said stephen roach of morgan stanley and co inc . `` this sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters . '' `` the fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy , '' he said . `` they will not ease as long the dollar is weak , but clearly they can ' t tighten . '' david <UNK> of data resources inc said that the downward revision in february non - farm payroll employment to 236 , 000 from 337 , 000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected . while <UNK> left his first - quarter forecast of real u . s . gross national product growth at 3 . 5 pct , he said the march jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second - quarter growth forecast to 2 . 5 pct from 2 . 8 pct . bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc said the average monthly gain in non - farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237 , 000 , compared with 254 , 000 in the fourth quarter of 1986 . `` there ' s momentum in first quarter labor force activity , but less than assumed , '' he said . `` gains in goods - producing jobs were <UNK> at best . this rules out any <UNK> of the fed tightening for exchange - related purposes . '' in march , the average <UNK> fell back to its january level of 34 . 8 hours from 35 . 0 hours in february . manufacturing hours also fell back to their january level , totalling 40 . 9 hours in march compared with 41 . 2 hours in february . the commerce department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in march was concentrated in automobile , electrical and electronic manufacturing . robert brusca of nikko securities international said that a 13 , 000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs . economists said that a build - up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead . most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first - quarter gnp accounts . roach said he expects first quarter u . s . gnp to rise two pct , to be followed by a gain of 1 . 0 - 1 . 5 pct at best in the second and third quarters . he said the march drop in industrial activity `` is a reasonable response in light of the <UNK> contribution inventory <UNK> made to gnp . '' economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for march . they expect only marginal gains , if not small declines , for these indicators , compared with a february increases of 0 . 5 pct in industrial production and 0 . 9 pct in personal income . steve slifer of lehman government securities said the drop in march construction employment may also signal a drop in march housing starts , which rose 2 . 6 pct in february to 1 . 851 million units at an annual rate from 1 . 804 million units in january . the rate of unemployment fell to 6 . 6 pct , its lowest level since march 1980 , from 6 . 7 pct in february . but <UNK> pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force , which fell to 119 . 2 mln in march from 119 . 35 mln in february . `` this just means that there were fewer people looking for work , so the drop in unemployment doesn ' t mean much , '' he said . he said the latest employment report will not concern the fed because it does points to gnp growth in the first half of 2 . 5 - 3 . 0 pct , but `` it does suggest they can ' t afford to tighten to quickly either . '' the statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have <UNK> march labor force gains , just as seasonal factors probably <UNK> them in january and february , slifer said , but are consistent with his forecast of 1 . 8 pct first quarter gnp growth . economic growth remains sluggish , but <UNK> does not think that the federal open market committee changed policy at their meeting this week . `` at some point they will be more inclined to ease , '' he said . for the time being , however , the march employment report `` increases the likelihood they won ' t tighten , regardless of the dollar .

u . s . credit market outlook - prime rate the prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders citibank and chase manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a <UNK> over the credit markets today , economists said . bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days of heavy selling when citibank surprised the market by announcing a quarter - point increase in its prime rate to 7 - 3 / 4 pct . chase manhattan quickly followed . prices quickly fell by a full point , even though the dollar - the market ' s <UNK> concern of late - rose sharply on the news . citibank cited the higher cost of money , especially in the <UNK> , as the reason for raising its prime rate . part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears of a tighter federal reserve policy to defend the dollar , but economists said it is too early to tell whether the fed , whose policy - making federal open market committee , fomc , meets this week , is already tightening its grip on credit . `` the fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system ' s reserve needs this statement period , but i wouldn ' t conclude anything until i ' ve seen the fed data , '' said jeffrey <UNK> of chemical bank . reuter ^ m

dollar / yen intervention <UNK> to pressure the bank of france intervened to buy small amounts of dollars and sell yen in paris today to stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month ' s meeting of finance ministers of the group of five and canada , foreign exchange dealers said . but they said recent central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation . a bank of france spokesman declined all comment but sources close to the central bank said it had also intervened yesterday . dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with the bundesbank and bank of japan . the sources said the french central bank could have been in the market again today in two - way operations , not necessarily on its own account , but to counter short - term pressures arising from the end of the japanese financial year on march 31 . one major french bank said it bought between five and 15 mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149 . 28 to the dollar . another bank said it had been asked by the bank of france to say it was in the market , a departure from the central bank ' s usual insistence on <UNK> . but other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention , which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale . `` even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs , you would still be talking of a small overall amount , '' said one dealer . recent intervention by the bank of japan appeared mainly to have been required to meet year - end window <UNK> demand for yen . `` this is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a wider trend , '' the dealer said . operators have been extremely cautious about testing the dollar ' s trading ranges against the west german mark and japanese yen . these ranges were set in february ' s stabilisation agreement reached here by u . s . treasury secretary james baker and the finance ministers of japan , germany , france , britain and canada . but speculative pressures started to build again this week after baker was quoted on british television at the weekend as <UNK> earlier statements that washington had no target for the dollar . baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking the dollar down , telling a cable news network <UNK> and a senate committee he stood by the paris agreement . foreign exchange markets had been <UNK> his comments , he said .

no near term brazil coffee moves expected the brazilian coffee institute , ibc , is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest , trade sources said . ibc president jorio dauster is meeting government ministers , producers , exporters and market analysts to assess brazil ' s position in the light of the failure of talks in london earlier this month to set new international coffee organization , ico , export quotas . `` the failure of the talks means brazil has got to <UNK> its position completely , '' one santos exporter said . a meeting of the national coffee policy council is set for thursday , march 19 , and dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures . dauster told reporters on his return from london last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry . exporters said dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately . world prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ico talks and brazil has sold a reasonable 5 . 5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year . the exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of may and june export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set . with little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts , bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced , the level of the quota will be <UNK> in determining the competitiveness of brazilian coffee on world markets , they said . they noted that on february 16 , the <UNK> of a planned increase in the quota , april registrations were opened and closed after 1 . 68 mln bags were registered for export , a record amount for a single day . if may / june registrations are opened under similar conditions as before , brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2 . 0 mln bags per month . `` the problem would be how to limit sales , '' one exporter said . brazil ' s present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to <UNK> foreign exchange earnings . however , the sources said they expect the ibc to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at <UNK> brazil ' s dominant position as an exporter , but without causing a price war . general opinion among exporters was that brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1 . 5 and 2 . 0 mln would be to non - members of the ico . the 15 . 5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure brazil had offered to ship if ico quotas were <UNK> , although dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks . with the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year , brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7 . 0 mln , the sources added . however , the sources said brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities , as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as brazil tried to <UNK> on other producers ' markets . maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts , thus re - establishing brazil ' s market share after last year ' s unusually low exports of 9 . 9 mln bags , enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining <UNK> relations with the producer group which backed brazil ' s stance at the ico talks , they added .
ec wheat release unlikely to satisfy u . k . demand the european commission ' s decision to release an additional 300 , 000 tonnes of british intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market , traders said . some operators had been <UNK> a larger tonnage , pointing out that at this week ' s u . k . intervention tender the market sought to buy 340 , 000 tonnes but only 126 , 000 tonnes were granted . the new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand , they said , and keen buying competition for supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm . the release of the feed wheat followed recent strong <UNK> by the u . k . grain trade to the commission . there has been growing concern that rising internal prices , triggered by heavy exports , were creating areas of shortage in interior markets . the latest ec <UNK> will add 70 , 000 tonnes at the april 14 tender and a further 30 , 000 tonnes later in the month . the remaining 200 , 000 tonnes will be made available in may and june . news of the release produced an early downward reaction in local physical markets , but by midday some sections had halved early two stg losses while others were unchanged . ministry of agriculture figures for march indicate 1 . 85 mln tonnes of wheat and 1 . 74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the free market . however , some traders believe these figures are <UNK> and , while some may still be held on the farm , the bulk of wheat is already sold . some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores . a total of 2 . 10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started july 1 , leaving an <UNK> balance in intervention of about 1 . 59 mln tonnes . intervention barley sales have reached just over 1 . 0 mln tonnes , leaving about 753 , 000 tonnes , traders said . this season ' s u . k . export performance has <UNK> all early expectations and has created the present nervous situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in august . the market is sticking to its recent <UNK> of total barley and wheat exports of around 10 . 5 mln tonnes , a new record and nearly double the previous record of 5 . 9 mln tonnes achieved in the 1984 / 85 season . traders expect u . k . wheat exports to reach 6 . 0 mln and barley around 4 . 50 mln tonnes . the soviet union has booked a record total of 2 . 5 mln tonnes of british wheat and barley this season , but only 1 . 28 mln had <UNK> in customs export figures by march 25 , traders said . other ec countries have bought large amounts of british grain and for the july 1 / march 25 period had taken 2 . 59 mln tonnes of wheat and 2 . 06 mln tonnes of barley . this compares with 1 . 28 mln and 868 , 700 tonnes last season . the market is expecting prices , particularly wheat , to stay buoyant for the remaining few months of the season . if supplies become more difficult and prices strengthen further , feed <UNK> may increase cereal substitute usage , traders said .

cocoa deal seen positive , but no price guarantee the buffer stock rules agreement reached on friday by the international cocoa organization ( icco ) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price - support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices , many icco delegates and trade sources said . the accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35 - member icco council after two weeks of talks . european chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately , but world surpluses <UNK> the market will pull prices down again before long . `` if the buffer stock operation is successful , i doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further , and it will have no <UNK> at all to retail chocolate prices , '' a european dealer said . and if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying , or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so , the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically , dealers said . the buffer stock is the market - <UNK> tool of the icco , into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to <UNK> prices into a pre - set stabilization range . a new cocoa agreement came into force in january but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time . the new rules take effect immediately . the buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks , after <UNK> communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market , since prices are below the `` must - buy `` level of 1 , 600 special drawing rights per tonne specified in the agreement , the sources said . the buffer stock <UNK> has funds to buy a maximum 100 , 000 tonnes within a five week period , but its approach will be more cautious , buffer stock manager <UNK> <UNK> said . the buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250 , 000 tonnes of cocoa , 100 , 000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock . icco council chairman and ivorian agriculture minister denis bra kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices . ivory coast is the world ' s largest cocoa producer . `` we have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market , '' bra kanon told reporters after the council adjourned . bra kanon <UNK> the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94 , 000 tonnes estimated by the icco statistics committee . however , some producer and consumer members emerged from the final icco council meeting with reservations about the pact . ghana , whose high - quality cocoa is the world ' s most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country ' s export earnings , made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa , saying they were too high for <UNK> cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock . according to consumer spokesman peter baron of west germany , `` consumers <UNK> ' t perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules . we reached a very sensitive compromise ... there were no real <UNK> or <UNK> . '' some european community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks , and as a result , doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have , delegates said . under the new rules , the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas , using price differentials to reflect different qualities . non - icco member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock . london cocoa prices traded today around 1 , 300 stg per tonne , down from around 1 , 450 stg in january 1987 and 1 , 750 stg in january 1986 . a cocoa <UNK> scheme can take a further 120 , 000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it , according to the agreement . the <UNK> scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1 , 600 sdr lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been <UNK> , or if the buffer stock runs low on funds , it says . the icco will discuss <UNK> scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on june 9 / 12 , icco officials said .

german economic outlook seen fairly bright the outlook for the west german economy is relatively bright , with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year , <UNK> university ' s institute for world economy said . the gnp forecast by the institute , one of five leading economic research bodies in west germany , is more optimistic than that of the other institutes , some of which have recently reduced their gnp forecasts to between two and 2 . 5 pct . in a report the <UNK> institute said west germany ' s export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark ' s strength against the dollar and other major currencies . `` the danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears , all in all , limited , '' the report said . `` on the contrary , a slight rise in exports can be expected . '' the institute said past experience has shown west german exporters will move to <UNK> currency factors by cutting costs , trying to <UNK> new markets and adjusting their product ranges . they will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries . at the same time , the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year . west german gnp growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending , both of which will in turn be <UNK> by an expansionary monetary policy , the institute said . however , it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours . the institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in west germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation . it also warned that what it called the worldwide <UNK> of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession . it said central banks in industrialized countries , including the bundesbank , had followed the federal reserve board ' s expansionary course . the institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in u . s . policy towards a more restrictive policy . other central banks were likely to follow suit , causing a recession that could <UNK> the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world . although germany can not entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global <UNK> of monetary policy , it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home . the institute said this could be done by <UNK> that fiscal policy <UNK> a willingness to work and invest . taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned , and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986 . it also said the bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct .

japanese tariffs seen as worldwide warning the tough trade sanctions president reagan imposed on japanese exports are not only a shot across japan ' s bow but also a sign reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide , u . s . officials said . but robert <UNK> , a trade specialist at <UNK> institution , a think <UNK> , said `` a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our <UNK> . '' he said it left the united states open to retaliation . the u . s . officials said the 100 pct tariffs reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of japanese goods will also show congress that a tough pro - trade stand can be taken under existing laws , and no new protectionist legislation is needed . in the past year tough trade action had been taken against the european community over corn and sorghum , taiwan over beer and wine , south korea over <UNK> of <UNK> , patents and <UNK> and japan on tobacco . white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a `` serious signal `` to other nations on the need for fair trade practices . reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers , television sets and some hand tools because japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to u . s . products . the tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the american consumer , fitzwater said . reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing u . s . trade deficit . the alternative was that if he did not , congress would . the u . s . trade gap last year was a record 169 . 8 billion dlrs , and continues to rise , with japan accounting for about one - third of america ' s overall deficit . but there are other two - way deficits - with canada , west germany , taiwan and south korea - and reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all . reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that `` i regret that these actions are necessary , '' but that the health and <UNK> of the u . s . semiconductor industry was essential to american competitiveness in world markets . `` we can not allow it to be <UNK> by unfair trading practices , '' reagan added in the statement from his california <UNK> home at santa barbara . he said the tariffs would remain in force until japan <UNK> by the agreement . u . s . officials say the action today will show congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade . the white house aide said of the tariff action , `` it wasn ' t done to <UNK> congress , but because there was an unfair trade practice . '' the aide added , however , `` on another plane , it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices , an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws .

u . s . energy industry said in better health the u . s . oil and gas industry is in better health than it was a year ago , according to testimony given to the texas railroad commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today . the commission , which regulates the state ' s oil and gas industry , heard testimony from a number of high - level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out . `` the attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic ( than last year ) , '' commissioner james e . ( jim ) nugent told reuters . `` it reflects their ( the executives ) belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle , '' he added , `` and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again . '' the energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices , which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid - 1986 . prices have since <UNK> to around 18 dlrs a barrel . at the same time , a number of company executives <UNK> that the nation ' s domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help . production costs are considerably higher in the united states than in such areas as the middle east and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations . currently , there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the united states compared with an average of nearly 2 , 000 in 1985 . citing a study released yesterday by the department of energy , many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing u . s . demand , was leading to a growing <UNK> on imports , particularly from the politically volatile middle east . `` in the u . s . , 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices , increasing about 2 . 5 pct , or 400 , 000 barrels per day ( bpd ) , '' said j . s . simon , general manager of the supply department at exxon corp & lt ; xon > , the nation ' s largest oil company . at the same time , simon said `` u . s . oil production declined by 300 , 000 bpd , the first decline in several years , '' and `` net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5 . 3 mln bpd . '' noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel , depending on opec ' s ability to control production , simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels , leading to `` a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity , in excess of 10 mln bpd . '' he said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for `` governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry . '' citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and `` <UNK> `` legislation , simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax , total <UNK> of natural gas and improved access to federal <UNK> for oil and gas exploration . simon did not mention an oil import fee , which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nation ' s domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be <UNK> . in yesterday ' s report , the energy department said imports could make up 50 pct of u . s . demand by 1995 , adding that persian gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free world ' s total oil consumption by that date . arguing that `` oil is a political tool in every nation on <UNK> , '' frank <UNK> , chairman of & lt ; <UNK> oil co > , today called for a variable oil import fee , among other measures , `` before the <UNK> <UNK> of the middle east is <UNK> and our national security is <UNK> .

bayer confident of posting good 1987 results chemicals group bayer ag & lt ; <UNK> . f > said it expects to post another good result in 1987 after raising pre - tax profit to a new record high in 1986 . the company said that this was despite the mark ' s further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure . `` the further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade <UNK> and on the developments of exchange rates , raw material and energy costs . bayer said world group pre - tax profit rose to 3 . 30 billion marks in 1986 , exceeding the previous year ' s record of 3 . 15 billion . parent company pre - tax profit increased to 1 . 72 billion from 1 . 62 billion . the company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend . bayer paid a 10 - mark dividend on 1985 results , up one mark from a year earlier . bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non - operating results showed a further improvement . bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40 . 75 billion marks from 45 . 93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark . lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices , it added . in volume terms , however , 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985 , the company said without giving details . `` the western europe , north america and far east regions developed well in local currency , but here too the <UNK> of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture , especially in the case of north america , '' it said . bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986 , although turnover fell 4 . 3 pct to 16 . 77 billion marks . capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986 , resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs . this , combined with savings in raw material and energy costs , helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas . the rise in pre - tax parent company profit was due to lower extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income . plastics , <UNK> chemicals , <UNK> and <UNK> raw materials all developed well , it said . turning to the 1986 fourth quarter , bayer said that world group turnover fell to 9 . 67 billion marks in the last three months of 1986 from 10 . 43 billion in the same 1985 period . parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7 . 1 pct to 3 . 69 billion marks , with domestic turnover 4 . 1 pct lower and foreign turnover 8 . 6 pct lower . exports accounted for 65 . 3 pct of turnover in the quarter against 66 . 4 pct in the same quarter of 1985 .

german financial policy makers in rare <UNK> karl otto poehl , head of west germany ' s central bank , and finance minister gerhard stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank ' s independence . but a rare public row between the <UNK> poehl , president of the bundesbank , and stoltenberg , over a controversial investment tax proposal , has added to the <UNK> of the country ' s already nervous financial markets , bankers said . poehl told an investment symposium in frankfurt last thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates stoltenberg quickly issued a statement <UNK> poehl ' s criticism , saying west germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors . `` the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank and finance ministry does not <UNK> confidence in foreign investors , '' said one economist for a london broker , who asked not to be identified . bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy - makers would quickly <UNK> up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time . `` there are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling , '' said commerzbank ag chief economist <UNK> <UNK> . news on october 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct <UNK> tax <UNK> billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already <UNK> from rising interest rates at home and abroad . bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the bundesbank <UNK> , and allowing apparently conflicting details to <UNK> out into an <UNK> and uncertain market . both poehl , 57 , and stoltenberg , 59 , have been under extraordinary pressures lately . poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy , helmut schlesinger , <UNK> up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the <UNK> policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability . in recent statements poehl has <UNK> more like schlesinger . for years the <UNK> - <UNK> economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices . schlesinger now has a majority of support in the bundesbank council , and since late summer poehl has had to represent his views , bankers said . `` poehl is in a minority in his own house , '' said commerzbank ' s <UNK> . `` poehl is in a dilemma . he must follow a policy that is not entirely his own , '' said another economist . the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far , they will attract funds into the country , pushing up the mark and hurting west german exporters . the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the bundesbank ' s new <UNK> became clear in early october . since last thursday , united states treasury secretary james baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases . bankers said this could <UNK> a <UNK> of the 1986 war of words between the u . s . and west germany , in which u . s . officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to stimulate its economy and thus <UNK> in more u . s . exports . one way west germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990 . but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for stoltenberg than he had <UNK> for . the cool , <UNK> <UNK> , who was regularly voted most popular government <UNK> last year , had to face resistance from local <UNK> in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts . the <UNK> tax was intended to <UNK> one gap by raising 4 . 3 billion marks . but it has caused an <UNK> among bankers , who say it will push up borrowing costs . the extra amount this costs the government could <UNK> out the revenue the tax brings in . meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the country ' s worst political scandal . stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of <UNK> - <UNK> , where he heads the ruling <UNK> party . the state ' s <UNK> premier , <UNK> <UNK> , had to resign after allegations of a `` <UNK> <UNK> `` election campaign led to heavy losses for the <UNK> in state elections . <UNK> was found dead in a hotel <UNK> in geneva last weekend . police say the death appears to have been <UNK> . cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats , and was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt . when poehl ' s contract came up for renewal earlier this year , chancellor helmut kohl ' s <UNK> - led coalition government gave poehl another eight - year term . werner <UNK> , managing partner at <UNK> bank , said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again . but when poehl criticized stoltenberg ' s tax plans he was not only <UNK> what many bankers felt but <UNK> the bundesbank ' s independence of government , <UNK> said .

division seen on how to help u . s . oil industry the u . s . congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry , hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices , and the subsequent growth in oil imports , industry analysts said . `` the industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better , '' said daniel <UNK> , director of cambridge energy research associates , which recently completed a survey of the u . s . congress on energy issues . <UNK> said he saw mounting support within congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee . today u . s . energy secretary john <UNK> said he will propose tax incentives to increase <UNK> oil and natural gas exploration and production to the reagan administration for consideration . white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed . herrington said , `` i would like to <UNK> for one mln barrels a day ( addition ) to u . s . production . '' u . s . oil output was off to 8 . 4 mln bpd in the week of march 13 , down six pct from last year , the american petroleum institute said . oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be <UNK> for the near term . paul <UNK> , oil analyst for salomon brothers inc said that `` even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we ' ve only altered our average price <UNK> to about 17 . 50 dlrs for the year .

'' the association represents some 1 , 300 drilling and oil service companies . the <UNK> survey of congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff <UNK> battle . <UNK> said that the poll which was conducted in january by a former congressman , <UNK> <UNK> , showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the congressmen <UNK> largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry . at the same time 48 pct of the congressmen <UNK> opposed the fee with the <UNK> saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests . but 80 pct of the <UNK> said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise . <UNK> said that imports above 50 pct of u . s . requirements `` is a critical , <UNK> level . if they ( imports ) move above that level , a fee may not be <UNK> but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action .

lawson oil tax breaks to help new fields - revenue two new u . k . tax relief measures for oil producers , announced today , are aimed at encouraging developments in the north sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry , the inland revenue said in a post - budget statement . earlier , chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced in his annual budget to parliament that from today , companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of <UNK> development expenditure on certain future oil fields against petroleum revenue tax ( prt ) . to date , full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself , when its income stream began , but was not immediately available against other development expenditure , the statement said . the new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today , and will improve the post - tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed , it said . lawson also announced that he would <UNK> allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for prt relief to be offset against prt liability . this means oil - related expenditure in the u . k . or on the u . k . continental shelf , which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred , to be allowed against prt liability in any oil field , the inland revenue said . this brings the scope of prt relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures , and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs , it said . in due course , the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year , it calculated . the inland revenue statement also included other technical measures that lawson did not comment on in his budget speech . these included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of prt - exempt oil allowances through <UNK> in two past periods of allowance <UNK> . <UNK> rules on <UNK> allowed prt expenditure <UNK> were announced , while there were also <UNK> on rules on corporation tax and advance corporation tax relating to the so - called `` <UNK> <UNK> `` of activities in the u . k . and its continental shelf . the finance bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in november , it said . <UNK> lewis <UNK> , a north sea expert with stockbrokers wood <UNK> and co inc in <UNK> , thought the two <UNK> on prt would help the depressed offshore industry . he said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller north sea fields such <UNK> , don and <UNK> would be brought forward . early development of the larger miller and bruce oil fields might also be encouraged , he said . lewis <UNK> said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry , which suffered a huge amount of lay - offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year . he pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the southern basin . this means more jobs could be created , as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the north sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south . he said the prt relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry , although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year .

dutch official rate cut seen still likely a cut of about half a percentage point in dutch official interest rates is still in prospect , although economists said the timing would depend on bundesbank moves . speculation has been <UNK> that the dutch central bank , encouraged by a strong guilder / mark relationship and wide premiums for dutch money and capital market rates over german , might lower rates without the bundesbank moving first . last month , the central bank lowered its special advances rate to 5 . 1 pct from 5 . 25 pct after the bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 3 . 55 pct from 3 . 8 pct . that rate has remained in force , just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which <UNK> commercial bank borrowings . given a strong guilder , a further fall in the west german <UNK> rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff , forcing an official dutch rate cut , analysts said . in february , when the bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 3 . 5 pct , the central bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota . since then , however , both the central bank and finance ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates . in april , central bank president <UNK> <UNK> said he would follow any bundesbank cut , and last week the finance ministry expressed <UNK> when it raised 2 . 25 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100 . 10 pct for an effective yield of 5 . 98 pct , the lowest since <UNK> . technically , analysts said , there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota , and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market . bank economists and dealers said a west german move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the central bank easing the special advance rate , provided the guilder / mark relationship permitted . the central bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its <UNK> value within the european monetary system of 112 . 673 guilders per 100 marks . today , foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112 . 705 guilders per 100 at the fix , a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between west germany and the netherlands , dealers said . an economist at abn bank said he expected west german and dutch interest rates to ease in the short term . however , he said new wage agreements in west germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term . in the netherlands , the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil , or even negative , while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth . `` it will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation , '' the abn economist said . he said dutch money supply growth , which ran at 3 . 4 pct in january , could also contribute to some inflation . at amro bank , a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year . the bank expects dutch capital market rates , currently averaging around 6 . 1 pct , to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 5 . 6 pct . analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying <UNK> on the bond market which would bring yields down , probably only temporarily , while money rates could fall below five pct . currently , all periods are traded at 5 . 12 to 5 . 25 pct in the money market .

'' minutes of february ' s federal open market committee ( fomc ) meeting released friday showed that while the fomc left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy , foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift . however , economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish u . s . economic growth and the financial strains on u . s . banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any fed policy firming . there is broad agreement among economists that the fomc at last tuesday ' s meeting also left fed policy unchanged . this week ' s u . s . economic data are expected to have little impact . february consumer <UNK> credit numbers are due on wednesday , with march producer price data out friday . there may be mild relief in some quarters that the u . s . purchasing managers composite index , a closely - watched economic indicator , rose only to 53 . 9 pct in march from 51 . 9 pct . a friday rumor had put the number far higher . the index ' s first quarter average also was 53 . 9 pct , <UNK> into real gnp growth of about three pct if continued through 1987 . federal funds traded at 5 - 15 / 16 pct late friday and are expected to open about there today with no fed action seen .

fed data provide new evidence of tighter policy u . s . banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy , but they do support the market ' s assumption that the federal reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit , economists said . `` it ' s clear that the fed has firmed somewhat . discount window borrowings , net free reserves , the fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve <UNK> are all consistent with a modest tightening , '' said <UNK> johnson of first chicago corp . johnson , and several other economists , now estimate that the fed funds rate should trade between 6 - 1 / 4 and 6 - 3 / 8 pct . discount window borrowings in the week to wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day , producing a daily average for the two - week statement period of 689 mln dlrs , the highest since the week of december 31 , 1986 , and up from 393 mln dlrs previously . moreover , banks were forced to borrow a huge 5 . 2 billion dlrs from the fed on wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though <UNK> low treasury balances at the fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the fed had anticipated . however , economists said it is almost certain that the fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than <UNK> this week . they pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to <UNK> for reserves at the end of the week . first , economists now expect m - 1 money supply for the week ended april 29 to rise by a <UNK> 15 to 20 billion dlrs , partly reflecting the <UNK> in <UNK> accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes . as banks ' <UNK> - account liabilities rise , so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the fed . required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2 . 5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended wednesday , but economists said the fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected m - 1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late . second , an apparent shortage of treasury bills apparently left wall street dealers with too little <UNK> with which to <UNK> in repurchase agreements with the fed , economists said . thus , although there were 10 . 3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on wednesday night , the fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so . `` it ' s not at all <UNK> that the fed didn ' t add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of <UNK> , '' said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch economics inc . mccarthy estimated that the fed is now targetting discount - window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day , equivalent to a fed funds rate of around 6 - 3 / 8 pct . after citing the reasons why the fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data , economists said the fact that the fed delayed arranging overnight <UNK> of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy . jeffrey <UNK> of chemical bank had not been convinced that the fed was tightening policy . but after reviewing today ' s figures , he said , `` it ' s fair to say that the fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve <UNK> . '' <UNK> expects fed funds to trade between 6 - 1 / 4 and 6 - 3 / 8 pct and said the fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar ' s fall <UNK> pace . johnson at first chicago agreed , citing political opposition in washington to a dollar - defense package at a time when congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the u . s . trade surplus with japan .

cocoa buffer stock may face <UNK> battle - trade the international cocoa organization ( icco ) buffer stock could face an <UNK> battle to halt the <UNK> in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks , cocoa traders said . traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75 , 000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly , given the amount of surplus cocoa <UNK> the market . the buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the icco 10 day average indicator price is now at 1 , 578 . 03 special drawing rights ( sdr ) per tonne , below the 1 , 600 `` must buy `` level . rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the icco council . buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations , traders said . some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end - april when changes in months used to calculate the icco indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1 , 600 sdr `` must buy `` level . the icco indicator price is calculated from the average of the second , third and fourth positions on the london and new york futures markets . the daily price was 1 , 577 . 61 sdr per tonne yesterday . months used currently for the indicator are may , july and september , but these are set to change to july , september and december on april 15 , prior to may becoming the new york spot month , traders noted . the introduction of december into the calculations may lift the daily sdr price as december is currently quoted about 75 stg above may on the london terminal market . but the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10 - day average , the indicator which <UNK> his activities , traders said . `` the buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa , '' an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said . traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75 , 000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts . if purchases reach this level within six months , buying is suspended pending an icco council review of price ranges . but some cocoa market <UNK> said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor brazilian bahia temporao crop at 1 . 5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln . a lower than expected brazilian crop may cut the 1986 / 87 world surplus to between 50 , 000 and 70 , 000 tonnes , compared with a recent forecast by the icco statistics committee of 94 , 000 tonnes , traders said . in these circumstances , the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20 , 000 and 30 , 000 tonnes to lift prices above the `` must buy `` level . but some dealers said the icco buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market . the buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non - members could limit the buffer stock ' s scope for action , dealers said . most of the cocoa <UNK> available to the buffer stock is nearby in - store material of malaysian and ivory coast origin . but the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct malaysian cocoa as malaysia is not an icco member , while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day , which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material . limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non - member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of malaysian material , traders said . buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as ghana will have only a limited impact on futures , but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures . ghana ' s premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying , dealers said . `` the buffer stock may not help the terminal market , but will provide a <UNK> for quality cocoas , '' one trader said . traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were `` all <UNK> `` and that no one could hope to predict <UNK> what the result would be . <UNK> buffer stock buying should help prices , but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100 , 000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus , dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure . in june the icco is due to discuss rules for a <UNK> scheme as an additional market support mechanism .

poehl looks set for eight more years at bundesbank for currency dealers karl otto poehl is the <UNK> of speculators , for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in <UNK> the world ' s financial <UNK> for the last seven years , and for germans he is the guardian of the mark . president of the powerful and independent west german central bank , the bundesbank , poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year , government officials say . ( index of economic <UNK> , see page <UNK> ) but no official announcement has yet been made , raising <UNK> in west germany ' s business community . the <UNK> poehl spent seven years in bonn in top ministerial posts under the social democrats , now in opposition , before he moved to the bundesbank . there has been speculation that chancellor helmut kohl would try to replace poehl with a man closer to his own christian democrats . but officials noted that poehl has worked closely and successfully with finance minister gerhard stoltenberg since kohl ' s government took office in 1982 . poehl , the most senior central banker apart from paul volcker of the united states , <UNK> a strong international <UNK> which it would take a <UNK> years to build up . given these circumstances , kohl will probably <UNK> poehl ' s past as an adviser to former social democrat chancellor willy <UNK> , and top aide to helmut schmidt when he was finance minister , bankers said . it was schmidt who , as chancellor , appointed poehl to his present job in 1980 . in recent months , with the mark ' s strong rise against the dollar , poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the bundesbank ' s council , a highly conservative institution which has <UNK> pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation <UNK> hold . older germans can <UNK> two <UNK> of <UNK> inflation this century . but with consumer prices falling for much of 1986 , and inflation negligible so far this year , poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary <UNK> a little and concentrate on the dangers to the german economy of a <UNK> exchange rate . `` i am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar / mark rate have reached a high priority , also for the bundesbank , because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in west germany , '' he told business journalists in frankfurt recently . <UNK> <UNK> , head of research at citibank ag , says that poehl ' s <UNK> would guarantee flexible monetary policy . `` poehl ' s policy has always been a policy which does not focus so <UNK> on domestic factors , but also on the external economy , '' she said . an economist at a german bank , who declined to be identified , said `` if poehl is confirmed in his post , it will certainly be a plus for the <UNK> course which is not so <UNK> oriented towards money supply . '' one of poehl ' s great <UNK> recently has been to persuade the united states to stop `` talking down `` the dollar . for poehl , the significance of the february louvre accord was that the united states agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies . the louvre accord was <UNK> with <UNK> by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test . but in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact . `` this is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don ' t know - what the central banks can do , '' poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round , making a <UNK> ' s position <UNK> . poehl was <UNK> in <UNK> and worked as a financial <UNK> in the <UNK> before starting his ministerial <UNK> . a relaxed sun - <UNK> figure who <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over a glass of beer , he is hardly a <UNK> central banker . he is also a keen <UNK> who <UNK> to watch <UNK> and play <UNK> . poehl says currency market intervention can not substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are <UNK> . `` but you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment , '' he said . bundesbank dealers are very professional and <UNK> . `` they ' ve <UNK> the <UNK> of many people , '' he said . and unlike the speculators , poehl notes , the bundesbank dealers usually make a profit .

'' trustee savings bank plc ( <UNK> ) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 9 . 9 pct earlier this year . the 100 mln stg that <UNK> set aside for the loans was <UNK> within just a few days , according to a spokeswoman . `` <UNK> <UNK> an under 10 pct mortgage , '' she said , noting that within five days the bank <UNK> the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume . in short , the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to <UNK> on the direction of interest rates . if interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets . but if interest rates rise it is the <UNK> who has won the benefit of cheap money . household mortgage co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the june 11 elections on the assumption that a conservative party victory would help money market rates fall further , according to <UNK> young , managing director . young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument . but money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has <UNK> its plans for the time being . he said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably . however , he said that when the household mortgage co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to <UNK> them . this means <UNK> different mortgages together to <UNK> a bond and selling them to an investor . for technical reasons <UNK> is <UNK> and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages . in the u . s . , where fixed rate mortgages are popular again , <UNK> has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years .

coffee traders expect selloff after ico talks fail the failure of the international coffee organization ( ico ) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in london coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today , coffee trade sources said . prices could easily drop to as low as 1 . 00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1 . 25 dlrs now , they said . a special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas . no further meeting to discuss quotas was set , delegates said . quotas , the major device used to stabilize prices under the international coffee agreement , were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in brazil . with no <UNK> for quotas in sight , heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee <UNK> companies will <UNK> , the trade sources predicted . lower prices are sure to <UNK> down to the supermarket shelf this spring , coffee dealers said . the u . s . and brazil , the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively , each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks . <UNK> rosenbaum , u . s . assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks , said in a statement after the council adjourned , `` a majority of producers , led by brazil , were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria . `` we want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market , instead of their political influence in the ico . '' brazilian coffee institute ( ibc ) president jorio dauster <UNK> , `` negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas , not negotiate them . '' previously , quotas were determined by historical amounts exported , which gave brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60 - kilo bags . a majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme . but most consumers and a <UNK> group of eight producers proposed <UNK> up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks , which would reduce brazil ' s share to 28 . 8 pct . consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries ' export capabilities and make coffee more <UNK> available to consumers when they need it . a last - minute attempt by colombia , the second largest exporter , to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together . delegates speculated brazil ' s financial problems , <UNK> by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt , have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings . developing coffee - producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings , particularly some african nations and colombia , are likely to be hurt the most by the ico ' s failure to agree quotas , analysts said . the expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year , producer delegates forecast . the ico executive board will meet march 31 , but the full council is not due to meet again until september , delegates said .

cost of pik certificates to be <UNK> by congress congress , eager to find budget savings , launches a review of the u . s . agriculture department ' s generic commodity certificate program tomorrow , amid signs usda and the general accounting office , <UNK> , are at odds over how much the program has cost u . s . taxpayers . the <UNK> concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment - in - kind , or pik , certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays , administration officials who asked not to be identified said . usda officials , however , took issue with the report , saying it did not take into account storage , handling and transport savings that <UNK> to the government . the <UNK> then decided to re - examine the costs , sources said . the issue is an important one , because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending . agriculture under secretary daniel amstutz and <UNK> senior associate director brian crowley are set to <UNK> before the senate agriculture committee tomorrow . amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays , and that savings to the commodity credit corp , ccc , almost equal costs , department sources said . usda estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store , handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage . it was unclear whether the <UNK> , congress ' <UNK> arm , would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs , reagan administration sources said . the <UNK> is expected to point out that use of payment - in - kind , pik , certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold . the testimony by amstutz and <UNK> senior associate director brian crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to <UNK> ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of pik certificates . the ccc issues dollar - denominated pik certificates , or certs , as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters . certs can be used to repay <UNK> loans or exchanged for ccc commodities or cash . between april and december 1986 , ccc issued 3 . 8 billion dlrs worth of certificates , according to usda . up to another 6 . 7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between january and august 1987 , according to usda . certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because <UNK> can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate . <UNK> this practice , called `` pik and roll , '' would save the government 1 . 4 billion dlrs between 1988 - 92 , according to the congressional budget office , <UNK> . that estimate , according to a <UNK> official , was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments . the senate and house budget committees are known to be considering curbs on pik - and - roll transactions among other savings alternatives . the <UNK> last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs , or between five and 20 pct , more than cash outlays , one administration official said . however , the <UNK> has decided to <UNK> those estimates based in part on usda criticism , department officials said . the broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year . usda ' s economic research service , for example , has found that between june and august last year , the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel . between september and november , however , certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices , according to the <UNK> study , obtained by reuters .

european coffee trade proposes new quota formula european coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating international coffee organization , ico , quotas , dutch coffee trade association chairman chairman <UNK> van <UNK> said . van <UNK> , who is a council member of the european coffee federation , was speaking at the end of the <UNK> annual meeting . the new formula is based on six - year moving averages and would give brazil , the world ' s biggest coffee producer , an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement , van <UNK> said . if accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ico , the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement , van <UNK> said . coffee quotas were suspended in february last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought - <UNK> crop disaster in brazil . although prices are now considerably lower , consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re - introduction . `` brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota . but our proposal leaves it very little to object to , '' van <UNK> said . `` the existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality , '' he said . `` our formula <UNK> flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone . '' although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out , initial estimates suggest countries such as colombia , kenya , indonesia and costa rica would get slightly higher quotas , while others such as the ivory coast , el salvador and nicaragua would lose quota share , van <UNK> said . because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply , it should also prevent under - shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically <UNK> their following year ' s quota . `` if the ico consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the september meeting , most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula , `` van <UNK> said . at the same time much will depend on brazil ' s attitude . `` brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side . if there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal , we might just get an agreement , '' van <UNK> added .

german research institute lowers growth forecast the diw economic research institute said west german economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1 . 5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year . the institute , whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading german institutes , said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986 , and its prospects had <UNK> significantly since the autumn . the diw repeated earlier predictions that gross national product ( gnp ) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real , seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year . the diw said that even if the economy <UNK> in the remaining three quarters , it was unlikely that demand and production would rise strongly enough to bring gnp growth up to 1 . 5 pct . other institutes and economists have recently revised their forecasts for german 1987 growth to around two pct . in a report diw disputed arguments by other economists that the economy was showing mixed development , with domestic demand healthy but foreign demand weak . diw said the crucial split was between weak demand for capital goods , and strong demand for <UNK> and consumer goods , not between foreign and domestic demand . it noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been hit in recent months by the weakness of exports , which had caused west german firms to scale back investment plans . service industries , unlike manufacturing industry , were continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand , it said . in a separate report the <UNK> economic research institute in hamburg said west germany ' s real trade surplus would fall markedly this year . however , the nominal trade surplus would show little change from 1986 ' s record 112 . 2 billion marks because of a further improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared with 1986 , it said .
uganda <UNK> out of coffee market - trade sources uganda ' s coffee marketing board ( cmb ) has stopped offering coffee on the international market because it is unhappy with current prices , coffee trade sources said . the board suspended offerings last week but because of its urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it could sustain , the sources added . hundreds of ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been waiting several months for payment from the cmb , which has had trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the kenyan port of <UNK> . foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by holding up <UNK> of uganda ' s hard currency earnings from coffee exports , the government newspaper new vision said . the banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money and president <UNK> <UNK> is thinking of imposing a penalty for such delays , it added . banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that commercial banks have <UNK> the board only 77 billion shillings -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the current coffee year , while the government had asked for 100 billion . the cmb has 455 , 000 60 - kg bags of coffee , about 15 pct of annual production , <UNK> in <UNK> awaiting shipment . the crop accounts for over 90 pct of uganda ' s export earnings and the recent slide in prices to four - year lows is likely to more than offset an expected increase in production . cmb officials have forecast that because the government has restored law and order in important growing areas , uganda will produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending september 30 , about 25 pct more than in 1985 / 6 .

analysts peg u . s . cotton <UNK> 10 . 6 mln acres u . s . cotton farmers are likely to plant about 10 . 6 mln acres in the coming season , based on an average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts <UNK> up for the u . s . agriculture department ' s 1987 planting intentions report next tuesday . the annual report gives cotton traders their first <UNK> of what u . s . production might be in the 1987 / 88 season , which begins august 1 . trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10 . 2 to 10 . 9 mln acres . on march 18 of last year , the usda reported that cotton farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9 . 71 mln acres . four months later , the usda estimated that 9 . 67 mln acres had been planted as of june 1 . by january , its estimate of 1986 planted acreage nationwide was 10 . 06 mln . analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in 1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year ' s good demand and firm prices will be repeated next year . analysts said those factors make cotton a profitable crop . `` with cotton more attractive price - <UNK> , i think there is going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton . soybeans are <UNK> cheap , '' said <UNK> <UNK> of cargill investor services , whose comments were echoed by other cotton market specialists . changes in the u . s . cotton program also could lead to increased acreage , analysts said . they <UNK> that under the 1986 program , cotton farmers who used part of their crop as <UNK> for government loans were not responsible for the cost of <UNK> that cotton in government warehouses . but under the 1987 plan , the government will not pick up the tab for storage . analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from participating in the program , which could result in more cotton . `` the cotton program <UNK> a mandatory set - aside of 25 pct of a farmer ' s base acreage , '' noted <UNK> <UNK> of shearson lehman brothers . but farmers who elect not to participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have . some analysts said cotton farmers in the high - yielding western states would be most likely to steer clear of the program . `` western acreage should be up at least 20 pct , '' said one commission house analyst , whose estimate was based in part on forecasts made by the national cotton council during its annual meeting in late january . but others disagreed . `` i think some western growers have decided they should be in the program for security reasons . there ' s a lot of <UNK> in <UNK> you ' ll be guaranteed the government ' s loan price of 52 . 25 cents a lb . anyone outside the program is subject to the <UNK> of the market , '' said walter brown , market analyst for a major california cotton producer . some cotton specialists said their expectations for increased acreage might not be verified in tuesday ' s planting intentions report . `` anything the usda is announcing now is based on information they gathered before their cotton program was announced ( on march 20 ) , '' one analyst cautioned . she said traders will get a better idea of next year ' s cotton output when the usda ' s planted acreage report is released on july 9 . brown took that opinion a step further . `` i don ' t think planted acreage is important . what <UNK> is the <UNK> rate , '' the difference between acreage planted and acreage harvested . brown said the <UNK> rate this year was `` pretty high `` at 15 . 5 pct because of weather problems in key producing states . `` more normal would be about six pct , '' he said .

portugal ' s gdp forecast to grow four pct this year portugal ' s gross domestic product ( gdp ) will grow around four pct this year , the same rate as in 1986 , according to a bank of portugal forecast . total investment this year , the country ' s second as a member of the european community ( ec ) , will rise nearly 10 pct , again the same rate as last year , the central bank study said . it added that portugal ' s current account was forecast to show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1 . 13 billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year . last year ' s high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and raw materials , lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar . imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year and exports four pct compared with increases of 16 . 5 pct and 6 . 6 pct respectively in 1986 , the bank said . the forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the non - expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current government would be maintained , particularly in budget spending and income and in wage policy . the bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on the assumption that the international economic situation and portugal ' s world trade relations would remain more or less the same as in 1986 . the central bank said the high rate of investment estimated for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved since 1985 . this tendency was expected to continue this year , especially in the construction and public works sectors . financial aid from the ec had also helped to boost investment last year , the bank said .

<UNK> lifts world grain output estimate to record the international wheat council ( <UNK> ) lifted its estimate for 1986 / 87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1 , 377 mln , compared with 1 , 351 mln tonnes the previous season . in its monthly market report , the <UNK> said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987 / 88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986 / 87 . the one mln tonne upward revision in 1986 / 87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments . the <UNK> raised the 1986 / 87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes . it left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln . the <UNK> 1986 / 87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere . the <UNK> said the area harvested for wheat in 1987 / 88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect . at least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries . there is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the <UNK> said there are increasing signs world output may level off . although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook , the <UNK> said barley acreage is likely to fall in the european community but increase in canada . u . s . maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise . after damage to its maize crop last year , the soviet union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be <UNK> to this and other spring crops . improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive <UNK> methods could therefore see a marked rise in soviet maize output in 1987 , the <UNK> said . any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986 / 87 , the <UNK> said . it left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at <UNK> different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes , respectively , against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier . after record world durum wheat production of 218 . 8 mln tonnes last season , the <UNK> said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the ec , canada , the u . s . and north africa .

main features of new rubber pact the new international natural rubber agreement ( inra ) , like the 1979 pact , will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls . the new inra was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the united nations conference on trade and development ( <UNK> ) . in many <UNK> the main features in the new pact <UNK> those contained in the present one . the reference price , currently 201 . 66 malaysian / singapore cts per kilo , will be maintained -- unless between now and october 22 , when the 1979 inra expires , the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention ( `` may sell `` ) price ( 231 cts ) or below the lower intervention ( `` may buy `` ) price ( 171 cts ) for six months . if this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the international natural rubber council decides . the new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement . under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage . similarly , if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300 , 000 tonnes have been made since the last revision , the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage . another change introduced in the new inra is that price reviews will be held at 15 - month <UNK> instead of 18 . those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends . as in the present accord the `` may buy `` and `` may sell `` levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price , and the `` must buy `` and `` must sell `` levels at 20 pct of it . the lower and upper indicative prices ( floor and ceiling prices ) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents , unless the council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months . during the negotiations , consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock , currently 360 , 000 tonnes , rose to 450 , 000 tonnes . the maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400 , 000 tonnes , with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150 , 000 tonnes . under the new accord , the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price . at last friday ' s session , ahmed <UNK> , speaking for producers , said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created . <UNK> <UNK> of france , who spoke for consumers , agreed that the current agreement had worked `` relatively well . '' asked about the chances of success of the new inra , delegates noted that for nearly its whole life , the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the `` must buy `` level . they said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber . in addition , provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated , ruling out speculation . `` it is a sort of middle - of - the - road agreement , '' one delegate said . the new pact will be open for <UNK> at u . n . headquarters in new york from may 1 to december 31 this year . to become operational , it will require <UNK> by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports . delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now . during the <UNK> between the two agreements , the international natural rubber council will remain in place . the pact will enter into force <UNK> when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have <UNK> it .

oecd trade , growth seen slowing in 1987 the 24 nations of the organisation for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) , hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade , face slower economic growth , and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987 , the economist intelligence unit ( eiu ) said . the eiu said in its world trade forecast it revised oecd economic growth downwards to 2 . 5 pct this year , compared with a 2 . 8 pct growth forecast in december . it said the new areas of weakness are west germany and the smaller european countries it influences , and japan , <UNK> hit by currency appreciation this year . the independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for west germany to 2 . 2 pct from 3 . 2 pct in december and to 2 . 3 pct from three pct for japan . it said it expected the oecd to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988 , due in large part to a 1 . 50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices . it said the u . s . current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast , to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986 . it said it expected west germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year . the eiu said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16 . 50 dlrs a barrel by end - 1987 and 15 . 50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year , as adherence to opec output policy becomes increasingly <UNK> . it said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets , and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade - weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year ' s 18 . 4 pct drop . the average mark / dollar rate is put at 1 . 80 marks this year and 1 . 70 in 1988 while the yen / dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988 , it said . `` this is not a crash scenario but the dollar ' s <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> increases the risk of ending with a <UNK> rather than a three - point landing , '' the eiu said . `` talking will not stop the dollar ' s slide for long and the february meeting ( of finance ministers of the group of five and canada ) produced <UNK> promise of either a <UNK> shift to more <UNK> policies in west germany and japan , or a tighter u . s . <UNK> policy , '' it said . it said the key to the dollar ' s fortunes was the willingness of japanese institutions to buy u . s . government assets despite prospects of <UNK> a currency loss . `` thus far they have been willing , '' the <UNK> said , adding that if japan was <UNK> from buying u . s . bonds the dollar would collapse . to contain such a currency crisis , dollar interest rates would have to soar , bringing recession and a third world debt crisis , it said . on trade , the eiu said prospects for 1987 look `` increasingly <UNK> . '' import growth , forecast in december at 4 . 5 pct , is now seen slowing down to around 3 . 8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4 . 2 pct in 1988 , it said . the weakness of the west german economy is the biggest single factor , with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3 . 5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6 . 5 pct forecast in december , the eiu said . on the export side , it said it saw weak demand in west germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in europe , while japan ' s exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by u . s . exporters would respond only marginally to a lower , more competitively - priced dollar . it said in most of europe and in japan , raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986 .

lower u . s . soybean loan idea sharply criticized u . s . soybean <UNK> and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior agriculture department official that congress allow the u . s . soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4 . 56 dlrs per bushel next year . `` i don ' t know who in congress would propose that happening . politically it would be totally unacceptable , '' an aide to a senior farm - state senator said . usda undersecretary daniel amstutz said this week that congress should give usda authority to keep the soybean loan at its current effective rate of 4 . 56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4 . 77 dlrs . `` i ' m convinced that congress will not go along with this , '' american soybean association president <UNK> haggard said . amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4 . 56 dlrs , usda could then consider ways to make u . s . soybeans more competitive . his comments were seen as possibly indicating what the the administration ' s position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers ' income . using soybean specific certificates to further <UNK> the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive . usda secretary richard lyng , however , continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan , saying such a move would be too costly . `` there will be <UNK> of other options that will be considered before congress looks at that one ( the amstutz proposal , '' said bill o ' <UNK> , aide to rep . edward <UNK> ( r - ill ) , ranking minority leader of the agriculture committee . `` <UNK> representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very <UNK> about supporting a lower soybean loan , '' o ' <UNK> said . congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and decide that they can not increase it from its current 5 . 02 dlr basic rate , but that there has to be something <UNK> to increase soybean ' s competitiveness , david <UNK> , aide to sen . <UNK> <UNK> ( r - miss ) said . <UNK> , a <UNK> <UNK> of a soybean marketing loan , would support a soybean loan of 5 . 02 or 4 . 77 dlrs with a certificate <UNK> , <UNK> said .

fed ' s policy ease may end with 2nd qtr rate cut the federal reserve ' s move to easier monetary policy , begun with four quick half - point discount rate cuts in 1986 , will likely end with a final rate drop in the second quarter , analysts said . a poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to edge lower , with the fed likely to drop its basic lending rate from 5 - 1 / 2 pct late next quarter to help the economy . `` the fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a full - <UNK> recession , '' said raymond stone , chief financial economist at merrill lynch capital markets . stone said economic data available by late june may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut . but he said it may only be a quarter - point drop instead of the usual half point , to avoid hurting the dollar further . all of the economists agreed that the federal open market committee tomorrow will leave fed policy unchanged . the average forecast of those <UNK> projects roughly quarter - point drops by the end of june in both the treasury bond yield , to 7 - 1 / 2 pct , and the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another , to 5 - 7 / 8 pct . most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 7 - 1 / 2 pct . other broad predictions of the survey , relating mainly to the april - june quarter , follow : - the dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large u . s . budget deficit and a wide , but narrowing , trade gap . contacted after the dollar ' s steep drop in the last two business days , the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more , rather than less , than they expect . - oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range . - stocks will continue to <UNK> bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987 . stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest second - half economic rise . the outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be <UNK> up . - inflation as measured by the gnp implicit price <UNK> will rise to around 3 . 3 pct this year from 2 . 7 pct in 1986 . the sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation , as will a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year . - u . s . real gross national product , which grew at a two pct annual rate in the 1986 second half , should expand at respective rates of about 2 . 3 pct and 2 . 5 pct in the 1987 first and second <UNK> . first - quarter growth is put at a 2 . 4 pct annual rate , slowing to 2 . 1 pct next quarter . robert brusca of nikko securities co international sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those <UNK> . he expects real gnp , which grew at a 1 . 1 pct rate in fourth - quarter 1986 , to expand at a 3 . 3 pct rate this quarter and 3 . 5 pct next quarter . `` the economy will <UNK> back more strongly than many expect , '' brusca said . he said an <UNK> buildup in inventories , largely in autos , will add to first - quarter economic growth , with consumer spending helping later . `` we ' re running out of special factors to keep the economy <UNK> , '' said philip <UNK> of irving securities corp . his interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest . <UNK> said tax law changes and inventory <UNK> helped lift fourth and first quarter gnp growth , respectively . he expects 2 . 5 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative . <UNK> said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a <UNK> of inventories , lower capital investment , slow government spending and less construction . only a marginally <UNK> trade deficit will add to growth . he sees a 7 . 10 pct end - of - june yield on treasury bonds , with federal funds and prime rates at 5 . 50 and seven pct , respectively . nikko ' s brusca projects rates of 8 . 25 pct for bonds , 6 . 15 pct for funds and 7 . 75 pct for the prime rate . two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up <UNK> after the dollar ' s fall to 40 - year lows versus the yen in past days and news of pending u . s . trade sanctions against japan . david <UNK> of nomura securities co international inc raised his end - june bond yield forecast to 7 . 50 pct from 7 . 20 pct and a fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5 . 80 pct . <UNK> <UNK> , president of money market services inc , lifted his forecast of bond and fed funds rates an eighth of a point to eight pct for bonds and 6 - 1 / 4 pct for funds . both <UNK> and <UNK> left their end - june prime rate forecast at 7 - 1 / 2 pct . the higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that japanese investors will be less eager to buy u . s . bonds because of fear about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to u . s . trade sanctions . yields may have to rise to <UNK> other buyers . ...... end -

beghin - say not planning to withdraw sugar french sugar producer beghin - say is not currently planning to withdraw the sugar it has placed into intervention , despite the exceptionally high rebate awarded at this week ' s european community ( ec ) sugar tender , beghin - say president jean - marc vernes told reuters . the maximum rebate of 46 . 864 ecus per 100 kilos on wednesday was the largest ever granted , according to traders . vernes said he was satisfied the european commission has started to move in the right direction , but said his company had no plans to change its decision to put sugar into intervention . but vernes said he hoped that in the next few weeks a final agreement would be reached with the commission which would allow operators to withdraw the sugar from intervention . european operators offered 854 , 000 tonnes of sugar into intervention to protest about export rebates which they say are too low . over 785 , 000 tonnes of this sugar was accepted by the commission on wednesday , according to commission sources . under ec regulations , however , operators have another four to five weeks to withdraw the sugar from intervention before payment is made for it . a total of 706 , 470 tonnes of french sugar and 79 , 000 tonnes of west german sugar has been accepted into intervention , trade sources said here . this amount represents about a third of annual ec exports to non - ec countries . beghin - say declined to specify the amount of sugar it had offered into intervention , but said it was below 500 , 000 tonnes . producers say they have been losing 2 . 5 to 3 . 0 ecus on every 100 kilos exported due to the failure of rebates to fully bridge the gap between ec and world prices . wednesday ' s rebate was 0 . 87 ecus short of what producers say is needed to get an equivalent price to that for sales into intervention , traders said . vernes said operators hope to get a rebate which <UNK> to the full intervention price and said wednesday ' s tender was a step in the right direction . sugar producers here said the volume of sugar authorised for export since the <UNK> of the current campaign had been inadequate and that more should be exported now to compensate . trade sources said new regulations governing export rebates , which are due to be adopted shortly , may smooth the path for the commission to award larger export rebates in future . one source at a leading french sugar house said it seemed the commission had understood the protest action and was now moving towards <UNK> the situation accordingly , thereby allowing the operators to withdraw their sugar from intervention once they got <UNK> .

energy / u . s . oil output energy secretary john herrington has proposed several ways to boost u . s . oil production , but he said all would cost the treasury money and will come under close white house scrutiny before action is taken . one measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27 . 5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods . herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year . the white house , reacting , said it did not favor <UNK> the tax code , but would look at the proposal . herrington ' s proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department ' s report on energy and the national security . the report said u . s . oil imports , rapidly rising , could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security . he has said since in <UNK> and at news <UNK> that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria -- increase production , not cause economic <UNK> , and be low cost to the <UNK> . herrington said an import fee would meet the first test , <UNK> production but fail the second and third . he said it would raise production and return 120 , 000 oil workers to their jobs , but at the same time it lifted oil prices , the higher prices would cost 400 , 000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs . a tax on gasoline , he said , would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production . in any case , u . s . officials say , president reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax . options which meet herrington ' s criteria include : - loan - price guarantees to shield banks from <UNK> by borrowers because of lower oil prices . it was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger <UNK> that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs . - a five pct tax credit for exploration and development . it would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325 , 000 barrels a day , at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year . - a five pct credit only for geological and <UNK> expenditures . it would increase production by 80 , 000 barrels a day , at a cost of 65 mln dlrs . - lower bid <UNK> on <UNK> continental shelf acreage to spur exploration . a drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5 , 760 acre <UNK> to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard <UNK> lease to 144 , 000 dlrs . herrington also pressed <UNK> for existing administration proposals to deregulate natural gas , which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300 , 000 barrels daily . he also called again for congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf , which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil , and the arctic national wildlife refuge , which may hold nine billion barrels . herrington said he understood the reagan ' s reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals , but added he hoped his department ' s energy / security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry . another move herrington said he will press <UNK> , even though it had been rejected earlier by the white house , is to raise the fill - rate for the strategic petroleum reserve to 100 , 000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35 , 000 . this , he said , would further bolster national security in case of an oil - supply disruption .

u . s . banker predicts further dollar fall this year a leading u . s . banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge american trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels . <UNK> <UNK> , worldwide treasurer of & lt ; morgan guaranty trust co > , told arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in u . s . deficits on a lasting basis . speaking at the <UNK> annual congress of the <UNK> <UNK> association , <UNK> said an agreement reached last month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar around current levels left many questions <UNK> . `` i can not see any chance for a real turnaround ( rise ) in the dollar , '' <UNK> said . `` i believe there is room for a further fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987 .

doubts about accord seen weakening dollar further the dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as <UNK> <UNK> about the effectiveness of last month ' s paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates , senior foreign exchange dealers said . following its fall today to a record 148 . 40 yen , dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down . behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month ' s accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down , the dealers said . `` the recent remark by u . s . treasury secretary james baker that the paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a <UNK> on the agreement , '' said <UNK> <UNK> , general manager of mitsui bank ltd ' s treasury division . he said the market interpreted this as indicating the u . s . would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency . `` this eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention , '' <UNK> said . dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that bank of japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency . they said the central bank bought between one to 1 . 5 billion dlrs today , including direct purchases through brokers , and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the u . s . central bank in new york . most dealers said they doubted the u . s . federal reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar , but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen . `` if the dollar drops to that low level , it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into u . s . securities , which the americans don ' t want , '' said <UNK> <UNK> , chief money market manager of mitsubishi trust and banking corp . he said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986 / 87 business year ending on march 31 . but dealers said the longer - term outlook for the dollar remained bearish . this was due to the <UNK> performance of the u . s . economy , the continuing u . s . trade deficit and japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package . `` the americans are getting <UNK> at japan ' s inertia in stimulating its economy , '' said <UNK> <UNK> , assistant general manager of <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> bank ltd ' s international treasury division . in the paris currency accord japan promised a package of economic measures , after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed , to boost domestic demand , increase imports , and thus reduce its trade surplus . the package was expected in april , but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax . in the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future , <UNK> - <UNK> <UNK> ' s <UNK> said . dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the u . s . congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar .

u . s . housing data fail to clarify economic path <UNK> strong u . s . housing statistics for february can not be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth , economists said . building was boosted by two factors last month , unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates . but economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy , if any , will come from housing in coming months . and after a steady <UNK> , mortgage rates seem to be near bottom . u . s . housing starts rose 2 . 6 pct in february to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 . 851 mln units from 1 . 804 mln in january . it was the highest pace for starts since april 1986 . the rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 4 . 4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 . 764 mln units after dropping 11 . 52 pct to 1 . 690 mln in january . `` february ' s weather is usually more adverse for home building . because of seasonal factors it ' s difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road , '' said allan leslie of discount corp . the housing report is seasonally - weighted to compensate for weather - related <UNK> . as a result , <UNK> temperatures <UNK> the statistics . economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month . but several believe that rates will now consolidate before <UNK> up in late spring / early summer . `` builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying ' let ' s do it now ' , '' said mark <UNK> of the u . s . <UNK> of savings institutions in washington , whose members supply much of the financing for home building . but <UNK> doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the u . s . economy . he expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 9 . 50 pct fixed rate effective in february . last november , fixed rate mortgages were about 10 . 30 pct . as expected , the strength in housing was concentrated in the single - family sector . the multi - family area -- which <UNK> represents rental units -- remained weak due to high <UNK> rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective january 1 . single - family starts rose at a 5 . 6 pct annual pace to 1 . 317 mln units . multi - family fell 4 . 1 pct to a 534 , 000 rate . `` strength in the single - family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job . but we ' re probably not looking at a great deal of growth potential , '' said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets . mccarthy noted that the housing report , together with larger than expected gains in u . s . employment , industrial output and retail sales in february , may cause some observers to start <UNK> `` four pct gnp <UNK> `` for the first quarter . gross national product grew 1 . 3 pct in the fourth quarter . but mccarthy , who still expects first quarter real gnp to come in at an annual rate of 2 . 5 pct or slightly above , is not convinced that growth will pick up in future . `` the big story is the inventory re - building that ' s going on now , not all of which is <UNK> , '' he said . for example , u . s . <UNK> , who are already <UNK> with high stocks , produced at an annual rate of 8 . 3 mln units in february compared with domestic car sales of 7 . 3 mln . thus while inventories could contribute to gnp in the first quarter , they may result in <UNK> - back production and weaker growth in the second , he said . `` if most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we can not identify any improvement in export demand , then there is the potential for <UNK> in the second quarter , '' agreed allan leslie of discount corp . he is still evaluating first quarter gnp prospects . federal reserve chairman paul volcker said last week that current data do not show the <UNK> in trade has reversed . `` at the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter , we could foresee production slowing in the second , '' cautioned joe <UNK> of mccarthy , <UNK> and <UNK> inc , who expects first quarter growth of about three pct .

german institutes warn on money supply four of west germany ' s five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation . but in a <UNK> view the diw institute in west berlin , <UNK> recent statements by leading bundesbank officials , said the expansion seen over the last 1 - 1 / 2 years did not necessarily threaten stability . the five institutes issued a joint spring report , in which three -- <UNK> , hamburg and <UNK> -- forecast a two pct rise in gnp in 1987 , while west berlin and <UNK> predicted one pct . the four institutes said an <UNK> policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity . but experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which <UNK> the beneficial effects of monetary policy . given virtual zero inflation in west germany such fears may seem exaggerated , they said . `` but it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly <UNK> , forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy , '' they said . the economic costs of a <UNK> stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold , they said . the four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates . `` such <UNK> may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock , but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply , '' they said . a return to growth and stability did not require <UNK> central bank moves , but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts , which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations . the diw institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential . because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account . monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation . recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability . the 1979 / 81 inflation following strong 1977 / 78 money growth reflected other causes , such as rising oil prices and the falling mark .

pakistan not seen as major wheat exporter pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough , <UNK> <UNK> , special assistant on food and agriculture to the pakistani prime minister , said in an interview . no exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price , he said . <UNK> forecast that pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable . the government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices , and the land would be better used for other crops . <UNK> said the pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares . some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds . the aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1 . 8 to 1 . 9 tonnes per ha to at least 2 . 5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years , he said . <UNK> said the current 1986 / 87 crop , harvesting of which is just beginning , is expected to yield around a record 14 . 5 mln tonnes . this compares with a target of 14 . 7 mln and last year ' s yield of 14 . 0 mln . he said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly . the long - term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid - 1993 , taking into account pakistan ' s annual population growth rate of more than three pct . current consumption is some 12 . 5 mln tonnes . the current wheat reserve is 2 . 5 mln tonnes , <UNK> said . this compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes , which pakistan will maintain at all costs , and a `` strategic reserve `` target of two mln tonnes . despite the fact that stocks are a half - mln tonnes over target , the surplus will not be exported at present , he said . the government wants to keep an extra `` safety margin `` until it sees what effect the <UNK> of a 44 - year - old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption . new exports will be considered only in about a year ' s time when the 1987 / 88 crop can be <UNK> as well , he said . the new domestic policy , introduced on march 15 , is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo . with other costs this means a price in pakistani markets of between 2 . 30 and 2 . 50 rupees per kilo . under the old system , introduced during world war two and due to be <UNK> out by april 15 , some 50 mln <UNK> cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat <UNK> . <UNK> said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so <UNK> that only 20 to 25 pct of <UNK> wheat was actually reaching the consumer , the rest being <UNK> <UNK> to the mills . the <UNK> system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended , <UNK> said . prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system . the wheat price in <UNK> , the most expensive pakistani city , had dropped from 3 . 11 rupees per kilo on march 1 to 2 . 85 rupees on march 30 . <UNK> said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption , but it may encourage better use of side - products such as bran .

u . s . economy shows promising signs of growth the u . s . economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the <UNK> of the fourth quarter last year , private economists say . some of the <UNK> experienced in the october - december period had been expected to <UNK> over into the first quarter this year , as the tax law changes that went into effect in january slowed business and consumer spending . but some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the u . s . economy , although some economists remain cautious about the outlook . the commerce department reported today that new orders for durable goods in february jumped by 5 . 7 billion dlrs , a six pct rise , to 101 . 2 billion dlrs . even excluding volatile defense goods , durable goods orders rose a healthy 3 . 8 pct , the agency said . the february numbers <UNK> the expectations of many financial analysts , whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct . the january / february employment statistics suggest the gross national product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year , said lyle <UNK> , an economist with the mortgage bankers association . the u . s . jobless rate in february and january was 6 . 7 pct , the lowest rate since march 1980 . the number of new non - farm jobs rose by 337 , 000 in february after a 319 , 000 gain in january and a 225 , 000 december increase , the government said . the employment data suggests a gnp annual growth rate of about three to 3 . 25 pct in the first quarter , said <UNK> . much of that will be attributed to businesses <UNK> their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter , <UNK> said . he expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending . he also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi - family housing units . fidelity bank senior economist <UNK> levy said some of the fourth quarter <UNK> will continue . levy predicts gnp will grow at a <UNK> 1 . 5 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987 , accelerate during the second quarter and show a <UNK> 4 . 5 pct annual rate in the third quarter . the key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the u . s . trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar ' s value over the last year and half . `` the improvement will be gradual and long lasting , '' levy predicted . most of it will be through import reduction , but at least one - third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of u . s . goods become more attractive overseas . the reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit , which soared to record levels last year , will improve this year and the u . s . economy will grow by a <UNK> 3 . 2 pct for the year compared with a 2 . 5 pct rate last year . as part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit , the u . s . has been pressing west germany and japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the u . s . and others . u . s . officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the united states whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries . the u . s . economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt . the government last week said the u . s . economy grew at a modest 1 . 1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter . there were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the united states and those shipped abroad . the report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms , the u . s . trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986 . while fourth quarter economic growth was weak , corporate profits jumped a healthy 6 . 1 pct during the period , the government said . it also reported that inflation , as measured by the gnp price <UNK> , remained in check , growing a moderate 0 . 7 pct in the period , the lowest rise in 19 years . the government also reported that consumer spending , a key element of the five year economic recovery , jumped 1 . 7 pct in february , after falling two pct in january . the federal reserve board also reported that the manufacturing sector , which had been one of the weaker elements of the u . s . economy , was showing signs of recovery . in its latest report on current economic conditions , the fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from <UNK> or steady to improving . manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except dallas where orders remained sluggish . chase <UNK> chairman lawrence <UNK> said the pick up in the u . s . manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar ' s value . he said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity , but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either . he said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power . `` that pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years , '' <UNK> said . he sees economic growth <UNK> around a modest two pct level for the next few years .

dollar seen falling unless japan <UNK> economy underlying dollar sentiment is bearish , and operators may push the currency to a new low unless japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the paris accord , foreign exchange analysts polled by reuters said here . `` the dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150 . 00 yen and to fall even below that level , '' a senior dealer at one leading bank said . the dollar has eased this week , but remains stable at around 151 . 50 yen . six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in paris in february to foster currency stability . some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term , but a drastic fall is unlikely because of u . s . fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced japanese purchases of u . s . treasury securities , needed to finance the u . s . deficit . dealers generally doubted whether any economic package japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly , and said such measures would probably <UNK> further u . s . steps to weaken the dollar . under the paris accord , tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand , increase imports and cut its trade surplus . but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax , and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future , the dealers said . if no such steps are taken , protectionist sentiment in the u . s . congress will grow , putting greater downward pressure on the dollar , they said . the factors affecting the u . s . currency have not changed since before the paris accord , they added . `` underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still - sluggish u . s . economic outlook , the international debt crisis triggered by brazil ' s unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced <UNK> of the reagan administration as a result of the iran / <UNK> arms scandal , '' said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank . `` there is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140 . 00 yen by the end of this year , '' said chemical bank tokyo branch vice president <UNK> <UNK> . but operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention . dealers said there were widespread rumours that the u . s . federal reserve <UNK> some banks in new york to ask for quotes last wednesday , and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1 . 87 marks . the bank of england also apparently sold sterling in london when it <UNK> 1 . 60 dlrs on wednesday , they said . but other dealers said they doubted the <UNK> of central bank intervention , saying it may stimulate the dollar ' s decline because many dealers are likely to <UNK> such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars . however , first national bank of chicago tokyo branch assistant manager <UNK> <UNK> said `` the dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of march . '' other dealers said the u . s . seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on march 31 , because a weak dollar would give japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings , which could make them lose interest in purchases of u . s . treasury securities . u . s . monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid <UNK> rates , they said .

leading industrial nations to meet in april leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability , but u . s . officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth . the narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have <UNK> the normally <UNK> financial markets and next month ' s talks seem likely to build on that stability . a reagan administration official said the paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm . but he said in an interview that financial markets also understood , `` that all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels . that is in fact what has happened since paris . '' monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to <UNK> the <UNK> and cease to <UNK> over short - term policy objectives . instead they have focused on medium - term policy goals , but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings . the official refused to comment , however , on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year . on february 22 , the united states , japan , west germany , france , britain and canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions , given commitments by washington to cut its budget deficit and by <UNK> and bonn to boost economic growth . the shake - up would strengthen the u . s . position in future international talks . `` i think these changes will strengthen the president ' s hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the congress and the better off we are in international <UNK> , '' said the official , an administration economic <UNK> . `` so it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives . '' but the official also said the administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability . currency analysts believe the paris agreement set secret short - term target ranges for their currencies with a specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention . according to market sources , the ranges agreed were 1 . 60 to 1 . 90 marks to the dollar , and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar . there is no official confirmation that specific bands were set , although the agreement used the term `` ranges `` , for the first time in an international economic agreement . the paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels . last week , dealers said the federal reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark , which had breached 1 . 86 to the dollar . british authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling ' s strength . international monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers , who will review market performance and their own economic prospects , will <UNK> again in washington just before the april 9 <UNK> meeting of the international monetary fund . the sources said italy , which refused to join the paris pact , was invited back by treasury secretary james baker . since paris , there are signs west german growth is slowing , while u . s . officials said they were giving japan until april to show that an economic stimulus package was in the <UNK> . signs of concern about german prospects emerged recently when bundesbank ( central bank ) president karl otto poehl told bankers he would consider cutting west german interest rates if the fed was ready to follow suit . a reagan administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in germany . but he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the fed and the bundesbank . `` if there is such a provision it is private and if i talked about it , it would no longer be private , '' said the official , who asked not to be identified . public comments by fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged , but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the u . s . trade deficit remains <UNK> high , further coordinated action could be on the april agenda .

france faces <UNK> to change policies france ' s right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year . moving <UNK> into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2 . 5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2 . 8 per cent from a 2 . 8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september . finance minister edouard balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation , budget - cutting <UNK> and pay restraint . but trade union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members , raising the <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> of wage and price rises . and bank economists contacted by reuters said they believed prime minister jacques chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to <UNK> the economy later this year , perhaps in the autumn , to boost his prospects in presidential elections due by april 1988 . `` the outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago , '' said societe generale economist <UNK> <UNK> . `` we have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year . '' `` the big question is whether the government ' s policy of wage <UNK> will be maintained , '' he added . the government has set public sector wage rises at <UNK> 1 . 7 per cent this year , with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity . but the head of the socialist <UNK> union federation , <UNK> <UNK> , meeting with chirac today , renewed union demands already rejected by the government for <UNK> clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices . calling the government ' s policies `` <UNK> and <UNK> , '' he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment . he announced after his meeting that chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training <UNK> <UNK> , a widely <UNK> leader of the moderate force <UNK> labour group , put similar demands to chirac earlier in the week while the communist - led <UNK> , the largest of france ' s unions , declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority . but with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month , and still rising , government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident chirac could resist union pay demands . `` salary <UNK> was ended by the previous socialist government and i <UNK> think this administration is going to reverse that , '' commented michel <UNK> , economist at recently - privatised banque paribas . damaging transport and electricity strikes over christmas and the new year , partly blamed by the government for higher inflation , had <UNK> the unions power and popularity , he said . <UNK> said paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast , perhaps to 2 . 6 or 2 . 7 per cent this year against last years 2 . 1 per cent . `` but that would still be an exceptional <UNK> considering that for the first time since the second world war all french prices have been <UNK> , '' he commented . finance ministry officials said that the governments <UNK> of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0 . 9 per cent surge in january living costs . but they claimed it was a once - off phenomenon that should have no <UNK> - on impact on the rest of the year . both <UNK> and <UNK> said they agreed with that , so long as the government kept wages under control . prices could rise 1 . 5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year , <UNK> more than forecast this week by the national statistics institute , insee , <UNK> said . but the second half year should be better , he added . <UNK> , one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit , several analysts said . so long as public sector wages are held down , higher value added tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth , they said .

trade interests ready for battle in u . s . house u . s . lawmakers are <UNK> up for a <UNK> between <UNK> and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full house of representatives in late april . in a move to toughen u . s . enforcement of trade laws , a key house subcommittee last week approved a <UNK> - down version of legislation to require president reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices . the bill will be the <UNK> of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of american industries and turn around last year ' s record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit . generally , the bill ' s provisions toughen u . s . enforcement of trade laws . the trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices , such as dumping products in the united states at prices below cost of production . it also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry <UNK> that a surge in imports threatens its existence . in writing the bill , the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles . several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to reagan and said they intend to back amendments to `` get tough `` with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out u . s . products . but congressmen known for their <UNK> to free trade said the bill ties reagan ' s hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers . bill <UNK> , r - mi . , said the subcommittee ' s bill was not one `` that a free trader like me could endorse in all <UNK> , '' but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill reagan and republicans would ultimately endorse . the goal of trade legislation was `` to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements , '' he said . in a key concession made at the urging of ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski , d - <UNK> . , the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices . it also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the u . s . economy . rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the house wanted to pass a bill reagan would sign into law . reagan last year blocked senate consideration of a tough house trade bill he <UNK> as protectionist and this year he only <UNK> agreed to support a trade bill when he saw democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation . white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill ' s provisions , but he added , `` generally we feel very good about the <UNK> consideration of the trade legislation . i think we are progressing very well . '' the first battle will take place next week when the full house ways and means committee considers an amendment by rep . richard gephardt , d - mo . , to force countries like japan , south korea and taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the u . s . the subcommittee limited the gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the united states will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices , but would not automatically set off retaliation . organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition . <UNK> - <UNK> president lane <UNK> this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill reagan would sign would not be worth passage in congress . but rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying , `` i ' m not trying to write legislation to <UNK> lane <UNK> . i ' m trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president . '' rep . <UNK> <UNK> ( d - ga . ) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry , an aide said . reagan <UNK> a similar measure last year . house speaker jim wright of texas , one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries <UNK> by low - priced foreign competition , last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption .

bp & lt ; bp > does not plan to hike standard & lt ; srd > bid british petroleum co plc does not intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of standard oil co , bp managing director david simon said . `` we don ' t seen this as any progressive bidding game , '' he told reporters at a news conference . bp now owns 55 pct of standard ' s stock . simon said bp had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst , whom he would not identify , as saying bp ' s careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer . `` i think that ( an increase ) would be totally wrong . i think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about <UNK> , '' he said . `` let ' s wait and see how the offer runs .

u . s . sugar program cut sent to congress by usda the u . s . agriculture department formally <UNK> to congress a long - <UNK> proposal to <UNK> slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments . in a letter to the congressional leadership accompanying the `` sugar program improvements act of 1987 `` , peter myers , deputy agriculture secretary , said the reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop , down from 18 cts now . sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 . the payments would cost an estimated 1 . 1 billion dlrs , myers said . the administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the house of representatives next week by rep . john <UNK> , r - ill . congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the house or senate because politically - influential sugar and corn growers and high <UNK> corn <UNK> producers will strongly resist . the direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years . it also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20 , 000 short tons raw sugar per grower . for example , on the first 350 tons of production , a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988 , 4 . 5 cts in 1989 , 3 cts in 1990 and 1 . 5 cts in 1991 . the income payments would be based on the amount of <UNK> recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years , <UNK> is less , usda said . myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry . he said the current program has artificially <UNK> domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn <UNK> to make market <UNK> . u . s . sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a `` progressive contraction `` of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year , he said . this has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing . furthermore , usda said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar - containing products a competitive advantage . the result has been higher imports of sugar - containing products and a flight of u . s . processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar . usda also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on u . s . consumers and industrial users . in fiscal 1987 , usda said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar . `` <UNK> of this bill will reduce the price gap between <UNK> and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse <UNK> and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing , '' myers said . the following table <UNK> the rate of payments , in cts per lb , to growers and the quantity covered , in short tons recoverable raw sugar , under the administration ' s proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments . quantity 1988 1989 1990 1991 first 350 tons 6 . 000 4 . 500 3 . 000 1 . 500 over 350 to 700 5 . 750 4 . 313 2 . 875 1 . 438 over 700 to 1 , 000 5 . 500 4 . 125 2 . 750 1 . 375 over 1 , 000 to 1 , 500 5 . 000 3 . 750 2 . 500 1 . 250 over 1 , 500 to 3 , 000 4 . 500 3 . 375 2 . 250 1 . 125 over 3 , 000 to 6 , 000 3 . 500 2 . 625 1 . 750 0 . 875 over 6 , 000 to 10 , 000 2 . 250 1 . 688 1 . 125 0 . 563 over 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 0 . 500 0 . 375 0 . 250 0 . 125 over 20 , 000 tons nil nil nil nil
